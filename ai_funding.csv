2,"Artificial intelligence, big data and democracy","ExpectedOutcome:
Projects should contribute to at least two of the following expected outcomes:

Protect fundamental rights and European values from possible threats stemming from unregulated use of artificial intelligence (AI) and big data applications.
Explore the potential of AI and big data to reinforce fundamental rights and European values. Examine the effectiveness of monitoring and control protocols of established legislation and non-regulatory measures over AI and big data development and implementations.
Introduction of values-based frameworks to inform data governance and regulate the use of AI and big data.
Innovative uses of AI and big data to enhance citizen engagement and democracy.
 Scope:
Big data and AI are shaping our societies at an unprecedented rate. We produce an ever-increasing amount of data revealing people’s attitudes, preferences, views and opinions. Public and private actors collect it and use it in multiple ways: e.g. companies “privatise” data to augment commercial returns while, on the other hand, state actors can use it for safety and security applications and the public sector to provide better, tailored services to citizens.

AI and big data open great opportunities in many fields of public interest: education, training, health, safety and security, public services, as well as for democratic processes and civic participation. However, both private and public uses contain some risks at the expense of citizens’ rights. These technologies, being at the forefront of datafication processes, pose new challenges both to core individual values such as privacy, freedom and equality, as well as to European collective values, such as fairness, security, inclusiveness, accountability and democratic control.

Proposals should analyse challenges and opportunities for society brought about by AI and big data. They should explore how to protect citizens from potential abuse enabled by these technologies both in the private and public domains. New and established regulations to control platforms using these technologies (beyond GDPR) should be examined. Strategies and policy recommendations on how to ensure that philosophical, legal and ethical values are embedded in the development of these technologies as outlined in the White Paper on Artificial Intelligence – a European approach to excellence and trust[1], are sought.

Examination should lead to solutions protecting from the possible negative impacts of these technologies on fundamental rights and democracy. Equally, it should lead to strategies that leverage them for enhancing civic participation and democracy.

Issues at stake include, inter alia: data ownership and/or inalienability; regulation of data flows; neutrality and explainability of algorithms and machine learning; value-centric, decentralised and/or open source designs for data processing platforms; counter-powers to dominant platforms; sensitive applications such as face recognition; etc.

Proposals are expected to address some of the following points: To build evidence, to review and to analyse threats to and opportunities for democracy, personal and collective European values stemming from AI and big data. This should involve a specific focus on gender issues and vulnerable populations, including persons with disabilities and people at risk of discrimination. They should propose ethical standards enforced through regulatory and governance frameworks. Supported with operational guidance, they should help protect citizens, uphold European values and ensure public trust in AI and the processing of big data. Innovative, inclusive and participative uses of AI and big data for civic engagement and democracy, including through experimental approaches, should be explored. Research is expected to design ways to educate European citizens about these technologies to enable informed civic participation in shaping them. Projects should build on existing results, findings and good practices, for instance those focused on Responsible Research and Innovation, and relevant projects supported under Horizon 2020’s Science with and for Society programme.",Protect fundamental rights and European values from possible threats stemming from unregulated use of artificial intelligence (AI) and big data applications.

3,Developing Artificial Intelligence (AI) for diagnosis and treatment of paediatric cancer,"Objective:
The particularity of paediatric cancers being rare diseases necessitates a collaborative approach to collate and integrate the data collected in all member states, including best practices and new technologies in order to further develop common solutions. The use of big data for better insights in cancer genesis, outcomes and the long-term side effects of treatments is currently under-developed.

Artificial intelligence and machine learning are powerful tools allowing for complex data analytics on large-scale data sets with great potential for fostering precision cancer medicine for all young people in Europe. Further advances in the diagnosis and treatment of paediatric oncology will require multinational, multidisciplinary integrated healthcare and research data platforms that will allow real world data simulations of machine-learning algorithms and artificial intelligence that can be exploited in data-driven clinical decision support applications that directly benefit patients.

The project will create synergies and complement the activities under the pilot project funded from the previous call (PPPA-AIPC-2020) to support the development of multi-national approaches to facilitate capturing data on paediatric cancer from multiple sources, and build a multi-stakeholder network. It will have a particular focus on patients, survivors and carers as active contributors and participants in the co-creation and definition of user requirements and overall usability of applications of Artificial Intelligence technologies in paediatric cancer. The project will take into account and further complement the analysis of the challenges, needs and gaps in capturing data on paediatric cancer across EU/EEA countries produced by the pilot project funded under the previous call. It will further advance the framework to find solutions and prioritise opportunities to bridge existing gaps with a multi-national, multi-disciplinary approach, in particular with regard to user and stakeholder engagement. Mapping and building on existing multi-disciplinary and multi-national platforms/datasets and registries including the European Platform on Rare Disease Registration (EU RD Platform) the project will contribute to paving the road to a European point of access for integrated healthcare and research data platforms that collate clinical data, including, for example, clinical history, relevant diagnostic tests (pathology, genomics, radiological imaging), treatment interventions and clinical outcomes for childhood cancers. The project will contribute to a multi-stakeholder network to connect and facilitate the exchanges and dissemination of best practices in clinically relevant applications of machine-learning and artificial intelligence among all relevant stakeholders with a specific focus on user empowerment and feedback. The project should focus on multiple applications, for example radiological imaging, digital pathology, digital twins, integrated genotyping and outcome prediction algorithms and clinical decision-making. The project should consider the specificities of paediatric cancer, across types and stages of tumours.

Scope:
The European Commission adopted on 04 May 2021 a decision on on the financing of pilot projects and preparatory actions in the field of ""Communications Networks, Content and Technology"" and on the adoption of the work programme for 2021 (C(2021) 3006 final).

Paediatric cancers are a collection of diverse rare diseases that together represent individually life-threatening diseases and collectively a major public health issue. With 35,000 new cases and more than 6,000 children and young people dying each year in Europe, paediatric cancer remains the leading cause of death from disease for children and adolescents. Two-thirds of survivors live with the long-term treatment-related side effects that can be severe and impact on the daily life of half of those affected.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) in is an important enabler of advancements in the field of health and care: it can unlock data insights needed to support data-driven decisions for diagnostics and treatments. In particular, AI has the potential to carry out complex tasks that are currently performed by specialists to improve diagnostic accuracy, increase efficiency of throughputs, improve clinical workflow, decrease human resource costs and improve treatment choices. In this sense, AI technologies have the potential to ease the burden on the health system and improve access to healthcare (e.g. screening) in remote or low resource areas. AI may also play a role in training healthcare professionals.

Expected Impact:
The project will support research and innovation and further collaboration on artificial intelligence technologies applied for diagnosis and treatment of paediatric cancers. Project results are expected to cover a representative range of stakeholders and solutions across EU/EEA countries, with a particular focus on patients, carers and survivors. The project is expected to create synergies and complement the activities under the pilot project funded from the previous call (PPPA-AIPC-2020). The project should link to and collaborate with relevant stakeholder groups and EU initiatives (including the European Reference Network for Paediatric Oncology, ERN PaedCan and the European Platform on Rare Disease Registration (EU RD Platform)) and build on other EU-funded projects (for example, the Paediatric Rare Tumours Network – PARTNER project).","Artificial intelligence and machine learning are powerful tools allowing for complex data analytics on large-scale data sets with great potential for fostering precision cancer medicine for all young people in Europe.

5,Trustworthy artificial intelligence (AI) tools to predict the risk of chronic non-communicable diseases and/or their progression,"ExpectedOutcome:
This topic aims at supporting activities that are enabling or contributing to one or several expected impacts of destination 1 “Staying healthy in a rapidly changing society”. To that end, proposals under this topic should aim for delivering results that are directed, tailored towards and contributing to all of the following expected outcomes.

Clinicians, medical professionals and citizens have access to and use validated AI tools for disease risk assessment. Hence, citizens are better informed for managing their own health.
Health care professionals utilise robust, trustworthy and privacy-preserving AI tools that help them to assess and predict the risk for and/or progression of chronic non-communicable diseases. Hence, citizens benefit from improved health outcomes.
Health care professionals develop evidence-based recommendations and guidelines for the implementation of AI-based personalised prevention strategies. Hence, citizens benefit from optimized health care measures superior to the standard-of-care.
Health care professionals employ quantitative indicators in order to identify and follow-up on individuals with high risk for the development and/or risk for the progression of chronic non-communicable diseases.
 Scope:
It is widely recognised that health systems must put more emphasis on prevention and adopt a person-centred approach. Artificial intelligence (AI) along with the increased availability of health data hold great potential to pave the way for personalised prevention and enable progress towards risk prediction and early detection of chronic non-communicable diseases.

This topic will support multidisciplinary research, build on broad stakeholder engagement and support proposals developing novel robust and trustworthy[1] AI tools to enable timely personalised prevention approaches for chronic non-communicable diseases/disorders. The topic does not exclude any diseases/disorders.

Proposals are expected to develop and test AI tools for assessing and predicting the risk of developing a disease and/or the risk of disease progression once it is diagnosed, taking into account the individuals’ (or groups) genotypes, phenotypes, life-style, occupational/environmental stressors and/or socio-economic and behavioural characteristics, as necessary. Sex and gender aspects should be considered, wherever relevant.

The AI tools may include a broad range of technological solutions on their own and/or in combination with other relevant state-of-the-art technologies (i.e. AI algorithms, mobile apps and sensors, robotics, e-health tools, telemedicine etc.)

Proposals should implement proof-of-concept studies to test and validate the performance of their AI tools in the real-world setting and compare their performance to the established practice.

The applicants should ensure that the AI tools developed are driven by relevant end-users/citizens/health care professionals needs. Therefore, the proposals are expected to introduce concrete measures for the involvement of the end-users throughout the AI development process and not only in the last phases of development. SME(s) participation is encouraged with the aim to strengthen the scientific and technological basis of SME(s) and valorise their innovations for the people’s benefit.

Proposals should address all of the following:

Leverage existing high-quality health-relevant data from multiple sources (i.e. cohorts, electronic health records and registries, taking into account the individual’s genotypic/phenotypic, medical, life-style, socio-economic, behavioural data etc.) and/or generation of new high-quality health data necessary for the rigorous development of the AI disease-risk tools.
Develop the adequate performance metrics to assess the technical robustness of the developed AI tools for risk assessment of disease and/or disease progression and in particular their accuracy, reliability, reproducibility and generalisability. Proposals should assess the possible inherent bias introduced to the AI tools originating from the data quality used for their development.
Develop the criteria to assess the effectiveness of the AI tools for disease risk assessment in terms of improving health outcomes and enabling personalised prevention strategies.
Implement proof of concept and/or feasibility studies to validate the AI tools for risk assessment of disease and/or disease progression in a relevant end-users environment and/or real-world setting and assess their performance in comparison to the standard-of-care.
Proposals should adhere to the FAIR[2] data principles and apply good practices for GDPR-compliant personal data protection. Proposals are encouraged to implement international standards and best practices used in the development of AI solutions.

Integration of ethics and health humanities perspectives to ensure an ethical approach to the development of AI solutions. In relation to the use and interpretation of data, special attention should be paid to systematically assess for gender and ethnic bias and/or discrimination when developing and using data-driven AI tools.

To ensure citizens’ trust, wide uptake by user communities and scalability of the solutions across clinical contexts, actions should promote the highest standards of transparency and openness of the AI tool, going well beyond documentation and extending to aspects such as assumptions, architecture, code and underlying data.

Applicants are highly encouraged to deliver a plan for the regulatory acceptability of their technologies and to interact at an early stage with the regulatory bodies, whenever relevant.

All projects funded under this topic are strongly encouraged to participate in networking and joint activities, as appropriate. These networking and joint activities could, for example, involve the participation in joint workshops, the exchange of knowledge, the development and adoption of best practices, or joint communication activities. This could also involve networking and joint activities with projects funded under other clusters and pillars of Horizon Europe, or other EU programmes, as appropriate. Therefore, proposals are expected to include a budget for the attendance to regular joint meetings and may consider to cover the costs of any other potential joint activities without the prerequisite to detail concrete joint activities at this stage.

6,"Pushing the limit of robotics cognition (AI, Data and Robotics Partnership) (RIA)","ExpectedOutcome:
Proposal results are expected to contribute to the following expected outcome:

New generation of AI-Powered Robotics: Enabling robots to have more profound impacts than they currently have, in powering them with a deeper kind of AI, endowing them with a better perception and understanding of the world (up to semantic and explainable representations), This would allow the next generation of autonomous robots, with increased capabilities to work without/with limited supervision, as well as the next generation of interactive robots, with greatly improved intuitive, safe and efficient cognitive, social and physical capabilities, to assist humans.
In addition, depending on the focus of the proposal, the results are expected to contribute to at least one of the following expected outcomes

Smarter robots with improved capabilities, functionalities (including complex functionalities such as manipulation of delicate, irregular, dynamic or deformable objects, navigation in un-controlled and variable or challenging and harsh environments, and continuous human-physical interactions) and an increased level of autonomy over the current state of the art, necessary to address real-world problems, while ensuring safety and reliability.
Smooth and trustworthy (including safety and reliability) human-robot collaboration through advanced reactivity and mutual understanding, and human-centric automated adaptation of robots in human-robot interactions.
 Scope:
Proposals are expected to develop technologies and systems that significantly enhance the cognitive ability of robots from the current state of the art to achieve greater levels of interaction and autonomy. Proposals will address as appropriate the following:

Develop enabling technologies, both new and existing, that extend the current state of the art in robotics perception, cognition, interaction and action as well as develop novel or advanced tools for the design and configuration of robots and robot systems that speed up the process of integration thereby reducing the time taken to deploy robot solutions. To do so by addressing the modularity and composability of solutions both in the operational context of a wide range of action and interaction use cases.
There is also a need to address concepts such as trustworthiness, privacy, security and ethics already at the technology design phase.
Develop lifelong autonomous robotics able to tackle unknown situations and adapt in the long term in pushing the state of the art of AI-based robots that combine monitoring, learning, planning and acting in order to evolve in difficult environments over long period of time. Support from simulation tools could be considered, as appropriate.
Increase robot acceptance by handling adequately both human and robotic actions, with human-centric, advanced behavioural and elaborated planning models, and adopting multidisciplinary approaches including SSH[1], as well as end-user involvement in the design of solutions addressing human factors and interaction. Gender and intersectionality dimension[2] analysis should be a part of the proposals, where relevant.
Push the limits of robotics interaction, adopting an interdisciplinary approach to integrate methods and techniques that allow the machines to engage in physical interactions with people or the environment, safely and intelligently, through specific enabling technologies: intuitiveness and responsive human-robot interfaces; integration of robot perception with natural and artificial intelligence; ability to physically, stably, dependably and safely interact with the environment, including users and surrounding people; development of advanced control tools fully integrating the human in the loop when performing a task; development of advanced control tools for dexterous and safe manipulation, assistance, and locomotion in diverse environments (ground, air, water, space, in-vivo and including safety critical and hazardous environments that are corrosive, explosive, nuclear or at extremes of pressure or temperature) and in general for improved performance of robots; energy autonomy and resilience to highly limited and imperfect communication networks in on-field applications.
Two types of proposals are expected, either focusing on higher level of autonomy, expecting less reliance on human supervision, or focusing on human-machine collaboration.

In each case, improvement in the level of robotics cognition should be demonstrated through at least three real-world scenarios (including measurements of functional performance), showing also the potential added value of such improvement in such use-cases scenarios. Scientific and technological progress should be demonstrated by qualitative and quantitative KPIs, demonstrators, benchmarking and progress monitoring. Activities are expected to achieve TRL 4-5 by the end of the project

The first type of proposals will further develop the level of autonomy in building on the latest developments in areas such as advanced perception, smart sensors, intelligent action and interaction, reasoning and learning, increased interpretation and understanding of the complex real-world environments (possibly involving human actions), anticipation of the effect of actions, adaptation and re-planning, graceful degradation, safety and security, etc. They will, as appropriate, further develop such components, and integrate them in an advanced robotics system, consider the balance of on-board vs off-board processes and the access and utilisation of external data and cloud resources to guide tasks and missions by adding external knowledge to internal reasoning and decision-making processes.
The second type of proposals will further develop and integrate physical human-robot interaction, verbal/non-verbal communication as well as robot-environment/object interaction, embedding, as appropiate, safety, mutual understanding perception and interpretation of human actions, interaction situated in complex real-world environments and related motivations and social structures, joint goals, shared and sliding autonomy, ethical human-centric behaviour by understanding of physiological responses and emotions, etc. to reach truly smooth human-robot collaboration. This should as well integrate advanced control developments, and further develop them as necessary to guarantee the necessary speed for the required reactivity, ensuring natural, safe and smooth interactions with humans. Appropriate use should be made of data and knowledge accumulation from internal and external sources in order to guide reasoning and decision-making and the inclusion of explainability/transparency mechanisms[3] appropriate to the use case. Such proposals should adopt a multidisciplinary approach and involve the necessary expertise in SSH[1], in particular in ethics and human-centric design to enhance trust and acceptability.
When possible proposals should build on and reuse public results from relevant previous funded actions. Proposals should make use of connections to the Digital Innovation Hub networks, particularly those in Robotics, Data and AI. Full use should be made of the common resources available in the AI-on-Demand platform[5], Digital Industrial Platform for Robotics[6], data platforms[7] and, if necessary other relevant digital resource platforms. Communicable results from projects should be delivered to the most relevant of these platforms so as to enhance the European AI, Data and Robotics ecosystem through the sharing of results and best practice.

All proposals should also take into consideration trustworthy AI principles[8] including respect of human dignity and agency, as appropriate, given the technology focus.

This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on AI, Data and Robotics.

All proposals are expected to allocate tasks to cohesion activities with the PPP on AI, Data and Robotics and funded actions related to this partnership, including the CSA HORIZON-CL4-2021-HUMAN-01-02. Where relevant, synergies with other PPPs are encouraged.

7,European Network of AI Excellence Centres: Pillars of the European AI lighthouse (RIA),"ExpectedOutcome:
Proposal results are expected to contribute to the following expected outcomes:

Establishing a new pillar of the European AI lighthouse[1]
Reinforcing a leading unified European AI community
Scientific progress in AI, addressing major challenges hampering its deployment.
 Scope:
To ensure European open strategic autonomy in critical technologies such as AI, with huge socio-economic impact, it is essential to reinforce and build on Europe’s assets in such technologies, including its world-class research community, in order to stay at the forefront of technological developments.

Europe has undeniable strengths with its many leading research centres, but the efforts are scattered.

As stated in the communication from the European Commission on Artificial Intelligence for Europe[2] and the coordinated action plan between the European Commission and the Member States and Associated Countries[3], joining forces will be crucial for international competitiveness. Europe has to scale up existing research capacities and reach a critical mass through tighter networks of European AI excellence centres. The proposals should develop mechanisms to reinforce and network excellence centres in AI, bringing the best scientists from academia and industry to join forces in addressing the major AI challenges hampering its deployment; therefore, reinforcing excellence through collaboration in AI throughout Europe.

Such networks are expected to mobilise researchers to collaborate on key AI research challenges and to progress faster in joined efforts rather than working in silos, leading to fragmented and duplicated efforts. Such networks, are essential to reach critical mass and overcome the present fragmentation of AI research in Europe.

To complement and extend the initiative started in H2020 to develop a vibrant European network of AI excellence centres, and a vibrant AI scientific community, the proposals should create a network of excellence for the following topic:

Safe and secure AI addressing safety and security by design: foster the collaboration between AI with safety engineering communities, security, cybersecurity and related communities, to develop safe-by-design and secure-by-design AI, data and robotics systems, contributing to safety and security of citizens and any users of such AI-powered systems. The focus is on research, but the work should also contribute to good practices, standards and certification, complying with regulations for AI safety and protection of fundamental rights.

Topics to be covered include, but are not limited to:

Technical robustness and safety, incl. methods for evaluating the resilience of systems, and standardized ways of quantifying robustness of AI
Privacy preserving techniques and infrastructures
Human agency and oversight in terms of system security and safety; including explainability in human-readable terms allowing to detect/prevent/mitigate/recover from harm and threats.
Proposals will bring together the best European research teams around AI to join forces and address major technical as well as sector- or societal-driven challenges in strengthening excellence, networking, multidisciplinarity and developing academia-industry synergies, as relevant.

Composition of the Network:

It should be driven by leading researchers in AI and AI relevant technologies from major excellent AI research centres, and bringing the best scientists across Europe, including also from promising research labs. It will bring on board the necessary level of expertise and variety of disciplines and profiles to achieve their objectives, ensuring a multidisciplinarity and multi-sectorial research approach, while respecting equality and diversity among the attracted talents.
Activities of the Network:

In order to structure the activities, the proposals will focus on important scientific or technological challenges with industrial and societal relevance where Europe will make a difference, by building on strengths, or strengthening knowledge to fill gaps critical for Europe.
Based on the identified challenges, the proposals will develop and implement common research agendas. The main vision and roadmap with targets within the projects, as well as methodology to implement and monitor progress will have to be specified in the proposal and can be further developed during the project.
Scientific progress will have to be demonstrated through testing on application specific datasets or use-cases. By extending the benchmarking of foundational research to application specific areas, the research community will simultaneously address advancements in AI and grand societal and technological challenges.
The proposals should define mechanisms to foster excellence throughout Europe, to increase efficiency of collaboration, including through networking and exchange programmes, and to develop a vibrant AI network in Europe.
The network will disseminate the latest and most advanced knowledge to all the academic and industrial AI laboratories in Europe and involving them in collaborative projects/exchange programmes. (This could involve projects defined initially or via financial support to third parties, for maximum 20% of the requested EU contribution, with a maximum of 60k€ per third party[4]).
The network will develop, where relevant, interactions with the industry, in view of triggering new scientific questions and fostering take-up of scientific advances
The network will develop collaboration with the relevant Digital innovation Hubs, World-class reference testing facilities, AI regulatory sandboxes and AI start-up initiatives, to disseminate knowledge and tools, and understand their needs.
The network should also foster innovation and include mechanisms to exploit new ideas coming out of the network’s work (for instance via incubators, start-up and spinoff initiatives and university tech-transfer funds).
Overall, each proposal will define mechanisms to become a virtual centre of excellence, offering access to knowledge and serve as a reference in their chosen specific field, including activities to ensure visibility.
The proposals should:

include mechanisms to spread the latest and most advanced knowledge to all the AI-labs in Europe
develop synergies and cross-fertilization between industry and academia
become a common resource and shared facility, as a virtual laboratory offering access to knowledge and expertise and attracting talents
provide broad access to AI excellence in Europe and also play an important role in increasing visibility
provide access to the required resources and infrastructure to support the R&D activities of the action, such as cloud and computing capacity, IoT, robotics equipment, support staff and engineers, where relevant, and the capacity to develop prototypes, pilots, demonstrators, etc.
include a number of major scientific and application challenges which will mobilise the community to join forces in addressing them. Continuous evaluation and demonstration of scientific and technological progress (with qualitative and quantitative KPIs, benchmarking and progress monitoring processes) towards solving the targeted challenges will motivate the entire network and support publications and scientific career developments (providing reference benchmarks to publish comparative results, using the reference data, scenarios, etc.), and also showcase the technology in application contexts, to attract more user industries and eventually foster take up and adoption of the technology.
include mechanisms to share resources, knowledge, tools, modules, software, results, expertise, and make equipment/infrastructure available to scientists to optimise the scientific and technological progress. To that end, proposals should exploit tools such as the AI-on-demand platform[5] and further develop and expand the platform, to support the network and sharing of resource, results, tools among the scientific community, maximising re-use of results, and supporting faster progress. Mechanisms to test results and continuously measure and demonstrate progress should be integrated in the platform, which is also important to support the scientific community, allowing also for comparative analysis. Openness and interoperability of components are encouraged to develop synergies and cross-fertilization between different approaches and solutions (e.g. through modularity of components or open interfaces).
include collaboration mechanisms among the best AI and AI-relevant research teams, but also mechanisms to bring all European AI teams to the highest level of excellence. This is also in view of supporting and encouraging the adoption of AI technologies in all Member States and Associated Countries, with particular emphasis on geographical aspect and elimination of gaps in digital competences and access between Member States and Associated Countries, as well as addressing existing gender disparities.
exploit and develop technology enablers, such as methodologies, tools and systems and exploit latest hardware development and data spaces, cloud and HPC resources.
Activities are expected to achieve TRL 4-5 by the end of the project.

Proposals are expected to develop synergies:

With other Networks of excellence centres in AI funded in H2020 or Horizon Europe, with a view of, all together, create vibrant European network of AI excellence centres. To that end, the activities should integrate with and complement the activities of the H2020-ICT-48 projects. The proposals are expected to dedicate tasks to ensure this coherence.
With relevant activities in AI, Data and Robotics, primarily in destinations 3, 4 and 6, but also in other destinations and clusters (in particular with cluster 3 regarding security-related activities), and share or exploit results where appropriate.
All proposals are expected to allocate tasks to cohesion activities with the PPP on AI, Data and Robotics and funded actions related to this partnership, including the CSA HORIZON-CL4-2021-HUMAN-01-02.

Background

The network of excellence centres on AI safety and security will contribute to the larger objective of the European Commission to establish the European AI lighthouse.

The AI lighthouse is expected to mobilise the AI community to collaborate on key AI research challenges and to progress faster in joined efforts rather than working in silos, leading to fragmented and duplicated efforts. This is essential to reach critical mass and overcome the present fragmentation of AI research in Europe.

The lighthouse will bring together stakeholders from research, innovation and deployment, to become a world reference in AI that can attract investments and the best talents in the field. The lighthouse will build on key pillars, each of them being a network of excellence centres specialising in a given topic where Europe has the potential to become a global champion. The initiative started with the H2020-ICT-48 call establishing the first networks of excellence centres and will further develop in Horizon Europe.","Proposals will bring together the best European research teams around AI to join forces and address major technical as well as sector- or societal-driven challenges in strengthening excellence, networking, multidisciplinarity and developing academia-industry synergies, as relevant.",EU,96500000,2021-10-21 17:00:00,"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-details/horizon-cl4-2021-human-01-03;callCode=null;freeTextSearchKeyword=Artificial%20Intelligence;matchWholeText=true;typeCodes=0,1,2;statusCodes=31094501;programmePeriod=2021%20-%202027;programCcm2Id=null;programDivisionCode=null;focusAreaCode=null;destination=null;mission=null;geographicalZonesCode=null;programmeDivisionProspect=null;startDateLte=null;startDateGte=null;crossCuttingPriorityCode=null;cpvCode=null;performanceOfDelivery=null;sortQuery=sortStatus;orderBy=asc;onlyTenders=false;topicListKey=topicSearchTablePageState",2021-07-14 20:40:00,1,noraadmin
8,Digitalisation as an enabler of agroecological farming systems,"ExpectedOutcome:
A successful proposal should support the farm to fork’s strategy objective of a transition to a fair, healthy and resilient European agriculture sector, in particular the goal of promoting agroecology, by improving understanding of the potential of digitalisation as an enabler of agroecology, a transformative, sustainable, healthy, resilient and inclusive approach to farming that can minimise farming pressure on ecosystems while generating fair economic returns for farmers.

Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:

Robust evidence of existing innovative digital tools and technologies that specifically support the transition to agroecology for different crops, farming systems and pedo-climatic conditions;
Improved understanding of the barriers, drivers, risks and usability aspects of digital tools that support the implementation of agroecological farming approaches for different crops and farming systems in different pedo-climatic regions;
Greater awareness among different actors of the cost-effectiveness and the economic, environmental and social performance of digital tools that support the implementation of agroecology, as well as the barriers and incentives for their uptake and deployment;
Pathways to address research and innovation (R&I) needs as regards digital tools that specifically support the transition to agroecology in the EU and Associated Countries.
 Scope:
Agroecology[1] is a holistic approach that relies on and maximises the use of ecological processes to support agricultural production. By working more with nature and ecosystem services, it has the potential to increase farms’ circularity, diversification and autonomy, and drive a full transformation of farming systems and agricultural value chains, from input substitution and beyond. Agroecological farming systems therefore have great potential to enhance the sustainability performance of agriculture and agricultural value chains that contribute to the objectives of the EU farm to fork strategy. Compared to industrialised and most conventional agricultural production, agroecology brings a higher level of complexity to farming systems. Digital technologies and agricultural equipment can play a key role in improving the performance of agroecological approaches at farm and territorial level, and boosting their uptake by farmers, inter alia by supporting their decision-making on farming practices. These technologies, which include artificial intelligence, geo-spatial technology, advanced image analysis procedures, the internet of things (IoT), robotics and sensors, are available and can be applied to most farming approaches. However, agroecological farming systems are more likely to benefit from tailored digital technologies and technology portfolios that enable, for instance, ongoing monitoring of the transition of farming practices and their performance through databases of in-situ data, or support for farmers’ decision-making through the integration of the different elements of an agroecological farming system in a holistic, system-based approach. The cost-effectiveness and performance of these solutions need to be evaluated in order to ensure they contribute to the effectiveness and sustainability of agroecological systems and to farm and/or landscape management. Activities should contribute to road-mapping for the improved productivity and sustainability performance of agroecological farming systems by assessing the availability of digital, data-based solutions tailored to agroecological farming and the potential to adapt “standard” digital technologies used in agriculture to the specific requirements of agroecological approaches for farm and landscape management. Due attention should be paid to aspects relating to security in the use of data, interoperability and the extent to which farmers and other actors in the food chain accept and are able to use these solutions.

Proposals should ensure that any data produced in the course of the project comply with the FAIR principles. Proposals should build on the results of relevant projects funded under Horizon 2020 and ensure collaboration with projects funded under the following calls in this work programme: HORIZON-CL6-2021-CLIMATE-01-05: Agroecological approaches for climate change mitigation, resilient agricultural production and enhanced biodiversity and HORIZON-CL6-2022-FARM2FORK-02-01-two-stage: Agroecological approaches for sustainable weed management.

Proposals should evaluate the need for such tools, and their implementation capacity for different crops and farming systems in different pedo-climatic zones, taking account of local natural habitat types. Proposals must implement the 'multi-actor approach' and ensure adequate involvement of the farming sector.

Proposals should document specific needs for digital technologies to support agroecological farming approaches, at farm, territorial and regional / national level. Building on existing data bases of digital technologies for agricultural production, proposals should assess the availability of tools tailored to agroecological approaches and identify gaps and needs for the adaptation of existing technologies or the development of new, innovative solutions to serve the needs of agroecological farming systems. Proposals should evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the solutions proposed, and assess their potential performance in agroecological farming systems for different crops, farming systems, biogeographical regions and pedo-climatic conditions. Proposals should analyse barriers to and incentives for the uptake and effective deployment of these tools, including analysis of cost effectiveness, risks, usability and affordability for farmers, as well as social and cultural obstacles. Based on this information, proposals should compile an open repository of available digital tools to address the specific needs of agroecological farming systems, including organic, under different pedo-climatic conditions. In collaboration with a wide range of stakeholders, including farmers, the private and public sector as well as consumer representatives, proposals should develop a roadmap for R&I on digital technologies to support agroecology in the EU and Associated Countries.

9,"Tackling gender, race and other biases in AI (RIA)","ExpectedOutcome:
Proposal results are expected to contribute to the following expected outcomes:

Increased availability and deployment of unbiased and bias-preventing AI solutions across a wide range of industrial and digital sectors
AI-based solutions for enhancing digital equality and social inclusion for women and girls, and other groups at risk of discrimination, such as ethnic minorities and the LGBTIQ community
Increased involvement of underrepresented persons in the design, development, training and deployment of AI.
Increased awareness, knowledge and skills about trustworthy, bias-free and socially responsible AI in the tech industry and scientific community
 Scope:
Research demonstrates how bias exacerbates existing inequalities and reinforces gender, racial and other stereotypes in, for instance, the labour market, education, online advertising systems, social media, taxation and the justice system.

Bias in AI can occur in three dimensions: training data, bias in algorithms, and bias in the interpretation of the results. This topic investigates preventing and mitigating bias in AI, focusing on (1) recommender and personalisation systems, (2) algorithmic decision-making, and (3) surveillance software, including facial recognition. Proposals may focus on more than one of these AI-based systems and should clearly identify the expected use-case/s in society.

Testing and assessment of AI systems with real-life data is needed to detect and reduce bias and improve accuracy, in line with the General Data Protection regulation. Assessing the fairness and social benefit[1] of AI-based systems and gaining more scientific understanding about their transparency and interpretation will be necessary to improve existing methods, and develop new ones in employment, advertising, access to health care, fraud detection, combatting online hate speech, and in general addressing bias affecting people’s ability to participate in the economy and society. This becomes particularly relevant in light of the pandemic and ongoing social justice movements, such as #MeToo and Black Lives Matter.

In line with the European Commission’ priority to strive for a ‘Union of Equality’, the European Pillar of Social Rights,[2] the Gender Equality Strategy 2020 – 2025,[3] the EU Anti-racism Action Plan 2020-2025[4], and the LGBTIQ Equality Strategy 2020-2025[5], proposals are expected to:

Develop technologies and algorithms to evaluate and address bias in AI-based systems. These underlying methods will help addressing gender, racial, age bias, as well as bias against persons with disabilities, people from socially disadvantaged backgrounds, and the LGBTIQ community in AI-based systems, and support the deployment of such bias-free AI-based solutions.
Develop standardized processes to assess and quantify the trustworthiness of the developed AI systems, in particular assessment of bias, diversity, non-discrimination and intersectionality[6] – based on different types of bias measures. This might include a methodology for considering diversity and representativeness of data, ensuring the reliability, traceability, and explainability of the AI systems, testing models on various subgroups and enabling appropriate stakeholder participation.[7] It could also include mechanisms to flag and remove risks of biases and discrimination.
Develop recommender and algorithmic decision-making systems which reduce bias in the selected use-case
Conduct trainings and awareness raising on preventing gender and intersectional bias for AI researchers, students and practitioners in line with the Digital Education Action Plan 2021 – 2027.[8] Trainings should also target practitioners of AI as a whole to avoid that the topic be limited to those with an already existing interest in socially responsible AI. These activities should be carried out in cooperation with the Public-Private Partnership on AI, Data and Robotics[9] and other relevant initiative and projects (such as the AI-on-demand platform).
Cooperate with the Public-Private Partnership on AI, Data and Robotics[9] and other relevant partnerships across a wide range of industrial and digital sectors, including representatives of international digital professional associations (e.g. IEEE), computing industry, hi-tech start-ups / SMEs etc. to further promote the use and uptake of the developed tools.
Proposals should focus on the development of tools and processes for design, testing and validation, including software engineering methodologies. The proposed approaches should also build tools to support deployment and uptake, auditing, certification (where appropriate). The inclusion of underrepresented and marginalised groups in the design development, and training of the AI systems, and a transdisciplinary approach, involving multidisciplinary and intersectorial partners in the consortium will be essential.

All proposals are expected to embed mechanisms to assess and demonstrate progress towards their objectives of meeting the key requirements for removing bias (with qualitative and quantitative KPIs, demonstrators, benchmarking and progress monitoring), and share results with the European R&D community, through the AI-on-demand platform, as well as the GEAR[11] tool to maximise re-use of results and efficiency of funding. It is essential to ensure that the publicly available results from relevant EU funded research projects (e.g. SHERPA, SIENNA, Panelfit, TechEthos) are taken into account.

Activities are expected to achieve at least TRL5-6 by the end of the project

The consortia should exchange information and build synergies with the relevant projects funded under Horizon Europe, Work programme 2021-202 WIDENING PARTICIPATION AND STRENGTHENING THE EUROPEAN RESEARCH AREA[12].

All proposals are expected to allocate tasks to cohesion activities with the PPP on AI, Data and Robotics and funded actions related to this partnership, including the CSA HORIZON-CL4-2021-HUMAN-01-02.","Proposals should focus on the development of tools and processes for design, testing and validation, including software engineering methodologies.

10,Integrated Disaster Risk Reduction for extreme climate events: from early warning systems to long term adaptation and resilience building,"ExpectedOutcome:
Projects’ results are expected to contribute to some of the following outcomes:

Improved dialogue and cooperation among scientific and technical communities, stakeholders, policy-makers and local communities in the field of extreme climate events and associated events (e.g. forest fires, droughts, floods, heatwaves and storms) and disaster risk reduction.
Enhanced community engagement for prevention, preparedness, response, recovery and learning to extreme climate events by strengthening knowledge and involvement of volunteers linked to recognised organisations into the planning, design and implementation of prevention, including building with nature, preparedness and emergency response activities.
Strengthening of disaster risk reduction and resilience building through innovative use of media means, namely by examining the potential of new communication tools and apps for better preparedness and response.
Overview of existing knowledge, tools and development of new tools (innovative data collection, satellite data, data harmonisation, artificial-intelligence tools, algorithms, sensors and decision-aid approaches) for early warning, response and resilience / adaptation to be demonstrated in the framework of real-case scenarios designed for training addressed to first and second responders, (national, regional, local) authorities and populations. The overview should document how legal and ethical rules of operation as well as fundamental rights such as privacy and protection of personal data are taken into account.
Based on the demonstrations, development of new governance strategies and robust decision-support methodologies for integrated risk reduction and improved adaptation to climate extreme events.
Improved understanding of enablers and barriers to multi-risk governance frameworks and multi-risk thinking, by involving interdisciplinary teams in different fields, particularly the social and behavioural sciences.
Cost-benefit or cost-effectiveness analyses of investment and regulatory strategies to protect people and nature in vulnerable areas.
Identification of production/livelihood practices (goods, services, activities etc.) at community and national level that contribute to increased local/global climate risks, and explore how these can be adapted so that they are both economically and environmentally sustainable.
 Scope:
In contemporary society, the capacity of communities and governments to manage expected and/or unexpected extreme climate events depends heavily on effective governance throughout the entire Disaster Risk Management cycle. This covers operational mechanisms ranging from short-term actions (e.g. early warning and forecast-based actions) to long-term adaptation strategies and resilience building, including nature-based solutions. A coherent integration between Disaster Risk Reduction, Climate Adaptation policies and Sustainable Development Goals as fostered by the European Green Deal and major UN initiatives should result in a comprehensive resilience framework, while improving synergies and coherence among the institutions and international agencies involved.

The effective implementation of global and European risk governance and policies to enable integrated disaster risk reduction for extreme climate events requires a collaborative involvement in risk assessment and information sharing across involved institutions, including the civil and private sector and the population.

Cross-regional, cross-border and cross-sector agreements covering all phases of Disaster Risk Management can improve the knowledge about extreme climate events such as forest fires, droughts, floods, heatwaves, storms and storm surges. In addition, improving effective prevention, preparedness and response rely upon specific national or local expertise and experience. It is important to overcome silos between technical and political authorities at all levels and advocate integration among involved actors. Multi-risk governance frameworks related to climate extremes, shifting from single to multi-risk thinking in governmental agencies, represents the key challenge for the future, considering how measures to improve the resilience of the built environment and communities may provide effective solutions to strengthen adaptation measures.

Creating an overview of existing knowledge, integrating tools and developing new ones for resilience and emergency management should include careful planning for interoperability amongst many actors. It is important that solutions pay attention to societal side-effects of integrating data about emergencies, for instance Apps, where persons concerned tend to share more willingly, but do not reflect consequences of that. Thus, the development of data management tools for emergencies need to respect fundamental rights, data protection and avoid function creep.

This topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.

Where possible and relevant, synergy-building and clustering initiatives with successful proposals in the same area should be considered, including the organisation of international conferences in close coordination with the Community for European Research and Innovation for Security (CERIS) activities and/or other international events.

11,"AI for human empowerment (AI, Data and Robotics Partnership) (RIA)","ExpectedOutcome:
Proposal results are expected to contribute to at least one of the following expected outcomes:

Truly mixed human-AI initiatives for human empowerment
Trustworthy hybrid decision-support systems
 Scope:
Build the next level of perception, visualisation, interaction and collaboration between humans and AI systems working together as partners to achieve common goals, sharing mutual understanding and learning of each other’s abilities and respective roles.

Innovative and promising approaches are encouraged, including human-in the loop approaches for truly mixed human-AI initiatives combining the best of human and machine knowledge and capabilities, tacit knowledge extraction (to design the next generation AI-driven co-creation and collaboration tools embodied e.g. in industrial/working spaces environments).

Each proposal will focus on one of the two following research objectives, and clearly identify it:

Reach truly mixed human-AI initiatives for human empowerment. The approaches should combine the best of human and machine knowledge and capabilities including shared and sliding autonomy in interaction, addressing reactivity, and fluidity of interaction and making systems transparent, fair and intuitive to use, which will play a key role in acceptance. The systems should adapt to the user rather than the opposite, based on analysis, understanding and anticipation about human behaviour and expectations.
Trustworthy hybrid decision-support, including approaches for mixed and sliding decision-making, for context interpretation, for dealing with uncertainty, transparent anticipation, reliability, human-centric planning and decision-making, interdependencies, and augmented decision-making. Transparency, fairness, technical accuracy and robustness will be the key, together with validation strategies assessing also the quality of the decision of the AI supported socio-technical system.
All proposals should adopt a human-centred development of trustworthy AI and investigate and optimise ways of human-AI interaction, key for acceptance and democratisation of AI, to allow any user to take full advantage of the huge benefits such technology can offer, regardless of their age, race, gender or capabilities. This includes development of methods to improve transparency, in particular for human users, in terms of explainability, expected levels of performance which are guaranteed/verifiable and corresponding confidence levels, accountability and responsibility, as well as perceived trust and fairness. AI could also be used to empower humans in supporting them to improve responsible behaviours, where appropriate, but this should be done in full respect of the requirements ensuring trustworthy AI, including human autonomy.

Innovative scientific approach towards human-centric approaches will require multidisciplinary and trans-disciplinary approaches paying particular attention to intersectional factors (gender, ethnicity, age, socioeconomic status, disability) including SSH[1] and other disciplines relevant to stimulate novel research avenues, and eventually improve user-acceptance. Collaborative design and evaluation with users involvement should also be considered.

As a pilot activity, proposals in this topic will dedicate part of their activities on investigating novel ways of engagement by citizens or citizen representatives with AI development, with a view of optimising experience towards improving usability and experience for citizens (both at professional or daily life environment).

All proposals should contribute to build the next level of perception, visualisation, interaction and collaboration, and understanding between humans and AI systems working together as partners to achieve common goals, sharing mutual understanding of each other’s abilities and respective roles.

All proposals are expected to embed mechanisms to assess and demonstrate progress (with qualitative and quantitative KPIs, benchmarking and progress monitoring, as well as illustrative application use-cases demonstrating concrete potential added value), and share results with the European R&D community, through the AI-on-demand platform[2], a public community resource, to maximise re-use of results, either by developers, or for uptake, and optimise efficiency of funding.

12,Artificial intelligence for sustainable agile manufacturing,"Projects are expected to contribute to the following outcomes:

Establishing European industry as leader in sustainable manufacturing and process industries through the application of trustworthy AI technologies;
Improving the environmental sustainability of industrial production;
Improving the agility of European industry and its resiliency to external and internal influences;
Integrating state-of-the-art AI technologies with advanced circular manufacturing and re-manufacturing technologies and systems, exploiting their potential across the entire product and service lifecycle;
 Scope:
This topic focuses on manufacturing and process industries, addressing the entire lifecycle of products and services from design to remanufacturing and including all the aspects primarily relevant for industrial production. The objective is to exploit the potential of AI as a transformation tool to support circular production in the entire manufacturing and process industry, with due consideration for standardisation activities when relevant. AI will be a strategic instrument to improve sustainability, agility and resilience to external and internal influences, taking account of the European Green Deal objectives. AI applications will be capable of optimising their actions based on limited human input, thanks to context awareness and information sensed from the physical environment, and will have the long useful lifetime typical of industrial environments.

Projects have to address the need for AI tool sets with simplified interfaces requiring only easy to acquire skills, and adapted to manufacturing environments without highly skilled personnel. Methods and tools will be provided to make AI solutions usable also for lower volume production and shorter time series, guaranteeing the quality of results even while using reduced resources for the training of AI algorithms. Generative approaches could be considered to help designing products and processes improving the sustainability of industrial solutions. The topic will integrate new or existing technologies to make them practically and economically viable in the industrial world; this should be demonstrated through at least two realistic use cases with demonstrable economic return.

Proposals submitted under this topic should include a business case and exploitation strategy, as outlined in the introduction to this Destination.

Research must build on existing standards or contribute to standardisation. Interoperability for data sharing should be addressed.

13,Enabling research infrastructure services for better use of imaging data to address challanges in thematic research areas,"Project results are expected to contribute to some of the following expected outcomes:

improved acquisition, quality, interoperability and analysis of imaging data from different disciplines (e.g.: health & food, climate and environmental research, digital transformation);
wider use of image analysis services based on AI in different scientific areas.
 Scope:
The availability of high-performance image analysis tools, including those based on AI, through the provision of RI services, has a great potential to improve the use of image data for research purposes. These services enable better use of imaging data by aligning data formats, ensuring better data quality and noise reduction, improving interoperability, applying advanced data analysis, interpretation and potentially visualisation, as well as by integrating imaging data with other data sets of different types.

Use of artificial intelligence as enabler for better exploitation of data sets for research queries will be an important contribution from research infrastructures to the Commission’s AI strategy proposed in the Commission’s White Paper On Artificial Intelligence - A European approach to excellence and trust (COM(2020) 65 final). Proposals under this topic bring together several complementary and interdisciplinary RIs to provide trans-national access (in-person, when the user visits the infrastructure to make use of it or remote access) and/or virtual access to integrated and customised RI services for challenge-driven research and innovation. Access also includes ad hoc users’ training and scientific and technical support. Harmonisation, customisation and virtualisation of RI services will also be supported.

Successful proposals will offer services, including AI-based services for improved analysis of imaging data in different thematic areas (e.g. environmental monitoring, life sciences, chemistry, physics,...). Appropriate links and complementarities must be ensured with the existing AI4EU platform[1] and relevant activities under Pillar II of Horizon Europe.

AI-based tools and services will make use of the EOSC commons as working environment where these tools, services and relevant data sets will be made findable and accessible for use, thus making EOSC operational for the delivery of research infrastructure data services for thematic research challenges.","The availability of high-performance image analysis tools, including those based on AI, through the provision of RI services, has a great potential to improve the use of image data for research purposes.

14,Innovative and customizable services for EOSC,"Project results are expected to contribute to all the following expected outcomes:

increased service offer and capabilities beyond the present landscape in addressing the current and anticipated needs of the research community at large;
increased availability of (pre)operational services that can be customised and integrated in the existing workflows of researchers across different disciplines, facilitating the cross-disciplinary collaboration, reducing the time to results and increasing productivity.
 Scope:
The aim is to provide researchers with a set of highly innovative new services that would exploit, in a structural way, cloud-based EOSC technologies and European compute and data management capacities.

Proposals should cover the following activities:

Development and improvement of existing pre-operational software, tools and open source services, aiming to be integrated to the service-based architecture offered through the EOSC;
Iterative and inclusive development in close cooperation/co-design with the relevant user communities;
Improving the TRL of the components and adding new features based on requirements from research communities, use of open source software and tools for wide availability and uptake;
The application range of these services for data intensive science is wide (e.g. automated extraction of information from scientific literature, experimentation, optimising experimental design, collection and analysis of heterogeneous and/or large-scale data, validation of data quality, repeatability and reproducibility in science, discovery and on-demand provisioning of open science resources and their reuse; storing, sharing and reusing research data, enabling secure data use and transactions, workflow management) making use of various enabling technologies, e.g. artificial intelligence and machine learning, natural language processing, automation, simulation, big data analytics or blockchain.

To be robust, customizable and scalable, all developments should be tested against 2-3 real life use cases from a variety of scientific domains. The projects should cooperate with other relevant and related projects and e-Infrastructures and large user communities. Joint use cases and testing across individual project boundaries are encouraged.

The services should be integrated in the EOSC core service platform[1] and proposals should include sufficient provisions to address the integration, including, appropriate IPR and licence agreements. The resources that the services will offer should be clearly identified in the proposals. The sustainability model for the long-term availability of services can rely on EOSC. Participation of industry players, including SMEs, is recommended for both the development and further exploitation of the project results.

15,"Verifiable robustness, energy efficiency and transparency for trustworthy AI: Scientific excellence boosting industrial competitiveness (AI, Data and Robotics Partnership) (RIA)","Proposal results are expected to contribute to at least one of the following expected outcomes:

World-class transparent, explainable, accountable and trustworthy AI, based on smarter, safer, secure, resilient, accurate, robust, reliable and dependable solutions.
Improved AI solutions aiming to meet the industrial[1] requirements in terms of autonomy, accuracy, safety, repeatability, robustness, resilience, security, etc.
Greener AI.
Next level of AI-based solutions, exploiting the intelligence embedded in the edge-to cloud infrastructure
Advances in complex systems & socially aware AI
 Scope:
Develop trustworthy AI technology, key for acceptance, to take full advantage of the huge benefits such technology can offer, and demonstrate the benefits in particular applications. This will require improvement in transparency: explainability, accountability and responsibility, safety, expected levels of technical performance (accuracy, robustness, level of ‘intelligence’ and autonomy, etc.) which are guaranteed/verifiable and with corresponding confidence levels.

Build the next level of “intelligence” and autonomy, essential to scale-up deployment, in solving wider set and more complex problems, adapting to new situations and context knowledge, addressing real-time performance requirements and data and energy efficiency, also for greener AI and robotics solutions. This will investigate approaches such as integration of both learning and reasoning, causality, contextualization and knowledge discovery, hybrid semi-parametric models (combining laws of physics with observations, aka physics-informed machine learning), human-in-the loop approaches, etc.

Contribute to making AI and robotics solutions meet the requirements of Trustworthy AI, based on the respect of the ethical principles, the fundamental rights, including privacy. Ethics principles needs to be adopted from early stages of AI development and design.

In this topic, solid scientific developments will be complemented, as relevant, by tools and processes for design, testing and validation, certification (where appropriate), software engineering methodologies, as well as approaches to modularity and interoperability, aimed at real-world applications. Where appropriate proposals are encouraged to propose standardisation methods to foster AI industry, helping to create, and guarantee trustworthy and ethical AI, and in support of the Commission regulatory framework.

Scientific proposals are expected to focus on advancing the state of the art in one of the major research areas below:

Novel or promising learning (such as unsupervised, self-supervised, representational learning capable of contextualization, transfer learning, life-long and continual learning, etc.) as well as symbolic and hybrid approaches. The objective is to advance “intelligence” and autonomy of AI-based systems, essential to scale-up deployment, in solving a wider set of more complex problems, adapting to new situations (making them “smarter”, more accurate, robust, dependable, versatile, reliable, secured, safer, etc.), and addressing real-time performance requirements, where relevant, for both robotics and non-embodied AI systems. This will include, among others, integration of both learning and reasoning, combining data-driven and knowledge-based models, causality, contextualization and knowledge discovery. Approaches can build on simulation and digital twins, or include data augmentation, knowledge modelling, federation of AI systems – including the use of distributed data – federated learning, and new AI methods ensuring scalability and re-usability. This topic also supports innovative or promising approaches addressing functional and performance guarantees.
Advanced transparency in AI, including advances in explainability, in transparency (with guaranteed/verifiable levels of performance, confidence levels, etc.), investigating novel or improved approaches increasing users’ understanding of AI system behaviour, and therefore increasing trust in such systems.
Greener AI, increasing data and energy efficiency. This covers research towards lighter, less data-intensive and energy-consuming models, optimized learning processes to require less input (data efficient AI), or optimized models, data augmentation, synthetic data, transfer learning, one-shot learning, continuous / lifelong learning, and optimized architectures for energy-efficient hardware, framework that optimises calculations for energy reduction in big data analytics. This also build on latest results in self-configuring, low-power or energy harvesting capable sensor devices, and low power data transmission and energy reduction in big data analytics (e.g. a framework that optimises calculations, leading to decreasing use of energy, etc.).
Advances in edge AI networks, bringing intelligence near sensors, in embedded systems with limited computational, storage and communication resources, as well as the integration of advanced and adaptive sensors and perception (including multi-modal sensing and active perception, distributed sensing, etc.), but also optimising edge vs cloud AI to maximise the capabilities of the overall system (both globally and for individual users). This builds on latest hardware development (for which synergies with the European Partnership for Key Digital Technologies (KDT) is encouraged), but does not cover such hardware developments.
Complex systems & socially aware AI: able to anticipate and cope with the consequences of complex network effects in large scale mixed communities of humans and AI systems interacting over various temporal and spatial scales. This includes the ability to balance requirements related to individual users and the common good and societal concerns, including sustainability, non-discrimination, equity, diversity etc.
Proposals should clearly identify its focused research area among the 5 listed above.

Proposals should include, as appropriate, the development of tools and processes for design, testing and validation, deployment and uptake, auditing, certification (where relevant), software engineering methodologies, as well as approaches to modularity and interoperability.

To complement the impressive progress in developing individual AI algorithms and components, proposals could also address the development of scientific foundations for designing, modelling, analysing, operating, monitoring, integrating, maintaining and extending AI systems.

In all these topics, involvement of multidisciplinary teams and transdisciplinary research, including SSH as appropriate, will be essential. The consortia should involve world-class research labs and top scientists, joining forces to address these major scientific challenges, and they are strongly encouraged to team up with European companies (large and small) representing major industrial sectors for Europe, genuinely interested in S&T progress in these fields, and which consider adoption of AI “made in Europe” key for their competitiveness[2].

While the proposals should address scientific foundations, relevance to real-world applications should be demonstrated, in particular through use-cases used to demonstrate scientific progress.

All proposals are expected to embed mechanisms to assess and demonstrate progress (with qualitative and quantitative KPIs, demonstrators, benchmarking and progress monitoring), and share communicable results with the European R&D community, through the AI-on-demand platform[3], a public community resource, to maximise re-use of results and efficiency of funding.

Activities are expected to achieve TRL 4-5 by the end of the projects.

Proposals should foresee activities to collaborate with projects stemming from topics relevant to AI, Data and Robotics, primarily in destinations 3, 4 and 6, but also in other destinations and clusters (in particular Cluster 3 on cybersecurity where relevant), and share or exploit results where appropriate.

This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on AI, Data and Robotics.

16,AI to fight disinformation (RIA),"Proposal results are expected to contribute to one of the following expected outcomes:

Advanced AI solutions against advanced disinformation techniques for media professionals.
Advanced AI solutions against disinformation for citizens.
 Scope:
The Media Action Plan is developed around three areas: recovery, transformation, and enabling and empowerment. Research and innovation is key to the area of the transformation. Innovative digital solutions play an important role in ensuring a pluralistic access to trustworthy and meaningful information and quality content.

The consumption of news media has substantially increased during the COVID19 crisis, with people seeking out relevant and factual information in a time of uncertainty. Unfortunately, online services have also been used by malicious actors to spread dangerous disinformation campaigns, with sometimes fatal consequences. Similarly the need for reliable and consistent social media interactions as well as for access to audiovisual content, gaming and other interactive activities has increased during COVID-19.

Notably, media and digital literacy is one of the key pillars in fight against disinformation, as also identified e.g. in the Communication: “Tackling disinformation - the European Approach”. With the modern social media being more and more AI based, and contemporary disinformation mechanisms increasingly sophisticated, advanced means are required to ensure a trustworthy environment. AI technologies applied to tools and services tailored to the media ecosystem will help the access to and creation and distribution of trustworthy information and facilitate countering sophisticated manifestations of disinformation.

The outcomes from this topic will offer exploitation and take-up opportunities for the Digital Europe and Creative Europe Programmes.

Research and innovation proposals are expected to respond to one of the following:

Advanced AI based solutions for securing a trustworthy online environment. Disinformation techniques are already today strongly AI based. Therefore, scientific researchers and media practitioners need to be equipped with quantitative and semi-supervised tools based on AI, and network science driven tools of least same level of sophistication, capable of detecting different forms of deep-fakes and tampered content and to understand how and where such type of content spreads online. The development of such tools require the involvement of a scientific community at the intersection between AI and computer science, mathematics, social network sciences, social sciences and other relevant scientific fields, closely collaborating with journalists and media practitioners, and equipped with the necessary computing power to analyse rich content (e.g. videos and images) and to automate the management, processing and analysis of the flow of information within online systems.
Advanced AI based solutions targeted to citizens for securing a trustworthy online environment. The solutions should foster citizens’ ability to identify, verify and combat disinformation through AI innovation. Solutions provided would include the analysis and tracing of various forms of content, correlation/comparison of various sources of information, exploitation of contextual information. Efficient and intuitive mechanisms to convey the information regarding quality/veracity of information should be addressed, as appropriate. Transparency and human oversight would be key, with a view of empowering citizens.
Proposals should include, as appropriate, the development of tools and processes for design, testing and validation, deployment and uptake, auditing, certification (where appropriate), software engineering methodologies, as well as approaches to modularity and interoperability. Relevance to real-world applications should be demonstrated. Various approaches to AI for detection, elaboration of confidence levels, contradiction trade-offs, pattern identification in a field of heterogeneous sources and media formats, and also for decision support need to be considered. Involvement of multidisciplinary teams and transdisciplinary research will be essential. The consortia are strongly encouraged to team up with European companies, which are part of the media ecosystem, including SMEs, and also with non-media industrial and technological expertise.

Proposals should clearly identify the expected outcome it will focus on (i.e. targeting media professionals or citizens).

Proposals should also coordinate and ensure complementarity with the ongoing media and social media R&I, related to projects in the field (e.g. AI4Media[1], Fandango[2]) and take into consideration the expectations of the Media Action Plan and the European Democracy Action Plan, and collaborate with the European Digital Media Observatory. The media data space (developed under Digital Europe) infrastructures and communities might provide an opportunity to pilot new tools produced by the selected proposals. Proposals should foresee activities to collaborate with projects stemming from the topics HORIZON-CL3-2021-FCT-01-03: Disinformation and fake news are combated and trust in the digital world is raised.

All proposals are expected to embed mechanisms to assess and demonstrate progress (with qualitative and quantitative KPIs, demonstrators, benchmarking and progress monitoring), and share communicable results with the European R&D community, through the AI-on-demand platform, a public community resource, to maximise re-use of results and efficiency of funding.","The Media Action Plan is developed around three areas: recovery, transformation, and enabling and empowerment.

17,"European coordination, awareness, standardisation & adoption of trustworthy European AI, data and robotics (AI, data and robotics partnership) (CSA)","ExpectedOutcome:
Proposal results are expected to contribute to either of the following expected outcomes, depending on their focus (the proposals should focus on one of the two expected outcomes exclusively):

Outcome 1:
Efficient AI, Data and Robotics Public-Private Partnership supporting the community and the implementation of the SRIDA[1].
Reinforced links among initiatives in AI, Data and Robotics in H2020, Horizon Europe, Digital Europe Programme, and other programmes (Networks of excellence centres, DIHs, pilots, data platforms, and other projects).

Outcome 2: Efficient support to the research community via the AI-on-demand-platform[2], a public community resource.

Scope:
The proposals should address one of the following focus areas:

Focus 1) the first type of proposals (EU contribution around EUR 4.00), will address the following aspects:

Support to the PPP on AI, Data and Robotics to develop a strong and inclusive network bringing, academia, industry, and public and industry users, including the major industrial European sectors and all relevant stakeholders, to guarantee strong coordinated efforts toward trustworthy AI, for the economy, society and environment. The network will also include national representatives, to link to national programmes and to foster synergies and coordination between the various European, national, public and private initiatives. Such coordination of efforts in research, innovation and expertise will be important for Europe’s leadership in AI. The objective is to support the community in defining and implementing the AI, Data and Robotics strategy for research, innovation, and deployment, and support the PPP in its coordination and support of the community in non-R&D tasks as well.
Coordinate and establish links with all relevant initiatives in AI, Data and Robotics in Horizon 2020, Horizon Europe, Digital Europe Programme, and other programmes (Networks of excellence centres, DIHs, pilots, data platforms, and other projects), in view of sharing knowledge, developing synergies, and coordinate the efforts when possible. Synergies should be developed with the relevant projects through efficient mechanisms (e.g. joint task forces), organisation of joint events gathering projects, etc.
Support and encourage the adoption of AI technologies in all Member States and Associated Countries, with particular emphasis on geographical aspect and elimination of gaps in digital competences and access between Member States and Associated Countries
Widespread educations and outreach programmes including public awareness and addressing acceptability and trustworthiness, informing about potentialities of AI but also ensuring that expectations are realistic to avoid backlash in the adoption. Such activities should target in particular the business community, with a particular focus on SMEs, as well as public administrators, and citizens at large.
Investigate and promote the potential contribution of AI, data and robotics to social welfare and sustainability, for example as framed by the UN SDGs (sustainable development goals) and highlight the value generated by the combination of AI/data/robotics in different environments.
Promote the adoption of trustworthy AI, data and robotics in procurement both public and private (B2B, B2C, B2G, etc.): this is crucial to foster the development of European AI industries and applications built on European data and compliant with the European regulatory framework, and to foster vast deployment of AI-based solutions.
Support to standardisation in view of boosting AI, data and robotics industry, helping to create, and guarantee trustworthy and ethical AI, data and robotics, and in support of the Commission regulatory framework. 
Standards should guarantee that AI, data and robotics technology in industry brings a high level of trust and safety of operations, and that it respects fundamental values and human rights. Standards should also ensure appropriate governance of AI, data and robotics throughout the system lifecycle and make sure that decision systems are trustworthy by being robust, un-biased, safe and secure.
Developing a coherent and broadly accepted set of AI, data and robotics standards requires a minimum level of support to ensure that all essential players are involved and that their voices are heard and in order to disseminate information and collect essential requirements. Support is also needed to coordinate and encourage contributions to standardization activities around the world.
An important dimension will be to explore needs for standardisation and qualification of equipment and processes, notably the application of Artificial Intelligence to business processes
The standardisation activities should include:

The creation of an online observatory of published standards and ongoing standardisation activities in AI, data and robotics worldwide
The identification of gaps and recommendations for key topics for future standardisation, in particular building on on-going activities in European Standardization Organizations (ESOs) and other relevant standardisation initiatives.
Support to a mechanism for information exchange between international and European Standardization Organizations (ESOs) to increase the transparency of ongoing work at international and European levels.
Support participation of European stakeholders in the international standardization initiatives
Networking of all key players, collection of essential requirements for AI, data and robotics standardization and dissemination of information
Recommendations on links between standardisation, certification and regulation
Recommendations for research and innovation activities supporting standardization
One large CSA is expected to cover all the aspects above. Close cooperation is expected with the second CSA supporting the AI-on-demand platform.

Focus 2) the second type of proposals (EU contribution around EUR 9.00), will address the following aspects:

The second type of CSA proposals will be in charge of the maintenance and necessary developments and services provision for the AI-on-demand-platform[3], a public community resource, with a focus on supporting the research community. Such platform should support the research community in providing modules, codes, tools, knowledge base to share and continuously strengthen the S&T excellence. It should also provide the necessary access to resources (data, compute power, equipment, etc.) to offer the AI, Data and Robotics R&D community an environment in which to develop new solutions and to ensure a leading position to Europe in S&T in these fields. It should also implement methods to compare solutions, and demonstrate progress. Proposals should demonstrate how their methodology will promote excellence, by serving the needs of the scientific community. In close cooperation with the first Coordination and Support Action, it will further develop the platform services that offer a common portal gathering relevant information, success stories, etc. The activities of this AI-on-demand-platform funded through Horizon Europe will serve the needs of the research community while the AI-on-demand platform funded through the Digital Europe Programme will focuses on AI tools at higher TRLs, to serve the needs of the market. Synergies will be developed between the two platforms to ensure complementarity and avoid overlaps. Results from this platform should be transferred to the other platform, after reaching sufficient level of maturity.

This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on AI, Data and Robotics.

All proposals are expected to allocate tasks to cohesion activities with the PPP on AI, Data and Robotics and funded actions related to this partnership. Proposals should include activities to collaborate with projects stemming from topics relevant to AI, Data and Robotics, primarily in destinations 3, 4 and 6 of Cluster 4, but also in other destinations and clusters, and share or exploit results where appropriate.

The environmental impacts of the proposed solutions should also be taken into account when making the case for the added value of the technology for the environment.

While the proposals must be application driven, involving problem owners to define needs and validate the proposed solutions, the focus is on optimising enabling AI, data and robotics technologies to maximise the benefit they bring in such applications. Proposals should adopt a concrete problem solving approach, exploiting and optimising the most suitable technologies and solutions at hand. The focus should be on real-world scenarios, which can benefit in short to mid-term from the technology and solutions and demonstrate substantial impact on the Green Deal, while taking into account the maturity of the technologies to solve the problems at hand.

Deep involvement of all relevant stakeholders (including SMEs), from technology providers to user industry, social partners, and relevant experts in operational and environmental impact assessment, will be essential. Special attention will be given to including users of diverse age, gender and background.

All proposals should incorporate training programs for non-expert users of AI, data and robotics systems, who are domain experts and need to know basic AI, data, robotics concepts, including the basics concepts of Trustworthy and ethical AI.

To reach their objectives, all proposals are expected to exploit synergies between at least two of the three components: AI, Data and Robotics and forge strong cooperation between to corresponding practitioners.

Proposals can involve either robotics-only solutions (for instance demonstrating robotics solutions in harsh environments), or a mix of robotics and non-robotics components (for instance in applications such as waste management, where a combination of robotics for waste segregation and data and sensor driven AI for process optimisation) or only include non-robotics AI and Data (for instance in energy optimisation, from production sites, through the network, and then end-user sites, with IoT components). All selected proposals are expected to include demonstrators at TRL 6 or above. At least half of the selected proposals will have to have a major robotics demonstrator; therefore, proposals should clearly specify their robotics demonstrator, if they chose to have one.

Proposals should clearly identify the expected outcome it will focus on.

Two types of proposals are expected:

Focused projects (EU contribution around EUR 3.00 million), involving the user industry and technology provider(s),
Larger projects (EU contribution around EUR 5.00 million), where a number of companies in a given application sector will identify in the proposal common challenges and use-cases, and organise competitive calls for AI, data and robotics solution providers to address such challenges. Competitive calls will be open to all types of companies, but only SMEs and Start-ups[1] will receive financial support to third parties, with a maximum of EUR 200 000 per third party[2] and 70% funding (100% for start-ups). At least 40% of the requested amount should be dedicated to financial support to third parties. The consortium will provide technical support with expertise in engineering integration, testing and validation to support the selected SMEs and start-ups acting as technology providers to demonstrate the added value of their solutions to address the challenges of the use-cases. Maximum one type of third party project will be funded per expected outcome[3].
In all proposals, user industries are expected to play a major role in the requirement and validation phases.

Besides financial support, these SMEs and start-ups successfully demonstrating the potential of their solutions, must receive support from business experts, provided by the action, to further develop their business and develop their market reach, and maximise their business opportunities.

When possible, proposals should build on and reuse public results from relevant previous funded actions. Proposals should make use of connections to the Digital Innovation Hub networks, particularly those in Robotics, Data and AI. Full use should be made of the common resources available in the AI-on-Demand platform[4], Digital Industrial Platform for Robotics[5], data platforms[6] and, if necessary other relevant digital resource platforms. Communicable results from selected proposals should be delivered to the most relevant of these platforms in order to enhance the European AI, Data and Robotics ecosystem through the sharing of results and best practice.

If proposals use satellite-based earth observation, positioning, navigation and/or related timing services and data, they have to prioritise Copernicus and/or Galileo/EGNOS over equivalent competing solutions offering the same services/data.

All proposals are expected to allocate tasks to cohesion activities with the co-programmed partnership on AI, Data and Robotics and funded actions related to this partnership, including the CSA HORIZON-CL4-2021-HUMAN-01-02. Where relevant, synergies with other European partnerships and Horizon Europe Clusters (Cluster 4 and Cluster 6 in particular) are encouraged.

This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on Artificial Intelligence, Data and Robotics.

20,Future European platforms for the Edge: Meta Operating Systems (RIA),"ExpectedOutcome:
Proposal results are expected to contribute to the following expected outcomes:

Next generation of higher-level (meta) operating systems for the smart Internet of Things with strong computing capacity at the smart device, system and edge-level, embedded in a compute continuum from IoT-to-edge-to-cloud. Such Operating system should be device independent and implement advanced concepts such as ad-hoc clouds, time-triggered IoT, and decentralised intelligence.
Increasing European autonomy in data processing required to support future hyper-distributed applications by building open platforms and an open edge ecosystem including business models, driven by European actors.
Achieving trust in these (meta) operating systems among actors in diverse industrial ecosystems by leveraging open standards and - where applicable - open source.
Emergence of an open edge ecosystem including midcaps, SMEs and start-ups that foster the up-take of an edge operating system, e.g. through a modular functional spectrum of executable apps and services, for nurturing a European network of innovators and developers.
Demonstrators in key industrial and societal applications, which in future require more power at the edge.
 Scope:
Europe needs to strengthen its supply and value chains in cloud to edge computing by integrating relevant elements of computing, connectivity, IoT, AI and cybersecurity. Exploiting network functions such as adhoc - cloud/fog communication not limited to 5G , the objective is to develop meta operating systems for the edge that enable cloud and edge computing orchestrations by bringing computation, data and intelligence closer to where the data is produced (sensors and devices) and by which volume, variety, interoperability, and velocity should be handled efficiently and securely. This will make AI training and inference at the edge viable and lead to a next generation of internet-enabled automation concepts virtualizing computing and networking functions, multi-state analytics and digital twinning of underlying objects to improve end-to-end response time, to optimise the CO2 footprint and benefit from the use of renewable energy sources. Validation should be done through proof of concept or prototype implementations for at least 3 different applications in domains such as mobility, logistics, manufacturing, energy and other utilities, buildings or farming.

Proposals are expected to use financial support to third parties (FSTP) to support industry, in particular SMEs, in take-up of emerging edge topologies, for populating and validating relevant use cases through experiments. A maximum of 20% of the budget is expected to be dedicated to FSTP and the maximum amount of FSTP is EUR 150.000 per third party for the entire duration of the action.

21,AI for cybersecurity reinforcement,"ExpectedOutcome:
Projects are expected to contribute to some of the following expected outcomes:

Reinforced cybersecurity using AI technological components and tools in line with relevant EU policy, legal and ethical requirements.
Increased knowledge about how an attacker might use AI technology in order to attack IT systems.
Digital processes, products and systems resilient against AI-powered cyberattacks
The proposal should provide appropriate indicators to measure its progress and specific impact.

Scope:
Artificial intelligence (AI) is present in almost every application area where massive data are involved. Understanding the implications and possible side effects for cybersecurity however requires deep analysis, including further research and innovation. On the one hand, AI can be used to improve response and resilience such us for the early detection of threats and other malicious activities with the aim to more accurately identify, prevent and stop attacks. On the other hand, attackers are increasingly powering their tools by using AI or by manipulating AI systems (including the AI systems used to reinforce cybersecurity).

The proposed actions should develop AI-based methods and tools in order to address the following interrelated capabilities: (i) improve systems robustness (i.e. the ability of a system to maintain its initial stable configuration even when it processes erroneous inputs, thanks to self-testing and self-healing); (ii) improve systems resilience (i.e. the ability of a system to resist and tolerate an attack, anticipate, cope and evolve by facilitating threat and anomaly detection and allowing security analysts to retrieve information about cyber threats); (iii) improve systems response (i.e. the capacity of a system to respond autonomously to attacks, thanks to identifying vulnerabilities in other machines and operate strategically by deciding which vulnerability to attack and at which point, and by deceiving attackers; and to (iv) counter the ways AI can be used for attacking. Advanced AI-based solutions, including machine learning tools, as well as defensive mechanisms to ensure data integrity should also be included in the proposed actions. Proposals should strive to ultimately facilitate the work of relevant cybersecurity experts (e.g. by reducing the workloads of security operators).

Regarding the manifold links among AI and cybersecurity, privacy and personal data protection, applicants should demonstrate how their proposed solutions comply with and support the EU policy actions and guidelines relevant to AI (e.g. Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI[1], the AI Whitepaper[2], EU Security Strategy[3] and the Data Strategy[4]). Proposals should foresee activities to collaborate with projects stemming from relevant topics included in the Cluster 4 “Digital, Industry and Space” of Horizon Europe. Generally, proposals should also build on the outcomes of and/or foresee actions to collaborate with other relevant projects (e.g. funded under Horizon 2020, Digital Europe Programme or Horizon Europe).

Proposals should strive to use, and contribute to, European relevant data pools (including federations of national and/or regional ones to render their proposed solutions more effective. To this end, applicants should crucially strive to ensure data quality and homogeneity of merged/federated data. Applicants should also identify and document relevant trade-offs between effectiveness of AI and fundamental rights (such as personal data protection). Moreover, privacy in big data should also be addressed.

Key performance indicators (KPI), with baseline targets in order to measure success and error rates, should demonstrate how the proposed work will bring significant progress to the state-of-the-art. All technologies and tools developed should be appropriately documented, to support take-up and replicability. Participation of SMEs is encouraged.","Artificial intelligence (AI) is present in almost every application area where massive data are involved.
