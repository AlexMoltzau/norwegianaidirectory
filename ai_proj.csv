137780,Noncommutative Geometry (ESF-program),2000,2004,"Recent developments in physics related to quantum groups had an immense impact on Algebra, bringing now deep problems and meaning to noncommutative algebra. The geometric background present in most phenomena transpires in the mathematical formalism. Howev er, this geometry remained ""virtual"" because a suitable geometry connected to the noncommutative algebra was lacking. Developing a geometric counterpart to the noncommutative algebra, often worded in terms of deformations or quantizations of algebras, req uires an abstract foundation allowing the desired generality of its applicability, but should also allow concrete calculations, either in the algebras or in (co)homology groups, reflecting real geometric aspects. The fundamental multidisciplinarity of the mathematics involved is obvious: category theory, algebraic geometry, topology and knot theory, homological methods, Lie theory, representation theory, differential geometry, rings of differential operators, with applications in physics, statistical physics or even Robotics (mobile robots). International and multidisciplinary cooperation is absolutely necessary for the development of this subject. On the European scale a concerted action integrating work-shops, exchange visits, study centers and schools , research in pairs, grants for researchers, intgrating cooperation of top specialists with a training aspect for young researchers in Europe, allow s for interaction at all research levels in many directions.",Ukjent,Annet,300000,Arnfinn Laudal,Ingen,NA
154265,An improved method for comparing the 3-D electronic structure of molecules in rational drug design,2003,2007,"An effective representation of the electronic structure of molecules must be properly based on quantum mechanics. Thus, we have developed the structure representation using quantum topology (StruQT) method where the electronic structure of molecuLes is re presented as critical points on the electron density distribution. StruQT is based on the Atoms in Molecules (MM) theory by Richard Bader. Comparing molecules in this representation means comparing sets of critical points and their properties for the different molecules involved. However, the StruQT method needs automatic routines for finding comparable critical points between molecules. Two approaches are suggested: - The use of inductive logic programming (ILP) which is a non-attribute based method from machine learning. ILP has been used successfully in drug design and is much lesssensitive to the problem of finding comparable molecular features. - The use of scale space trees of the critical points on the electron densities. Scale space analysis from the field of image analysis performs multiple smoothings of the electron densities to create a 4-D space where critical points merge into a hierarchy of simpler structures. These bifurcating critical point trees can be used to find comparable critical points between molecules.  The project has changed direction from creating its own software for finding critical points in scalar fields to using a commercial program and focusing on the modeling aspect of using AIM descriptors in QSAR/QSPR. In particular we are investigating the u se of inductive logic programming (ILP) which is very suitable for representing and comparing graph-like structure without having to perform 3D alignments. We will also investigate other non-alignment method approaches based on nearest neighbour geometrie s in combination with bond critical point (BCP) descriptors.A discretisation of the BCP for use with ILP will also be investigated.",Universiteter,UoH-sektor,1683150,Bjørn Kåre Alsberg,Institutt for kjemi,Trondheim
171125,New Information Theoretic methods for Intelligent Data Analysis,2006,2009,"The goal of the three year IT-IDA postdoctoral project is to develop new machine learning algorithms for intelligent data analysis, such as robust non-linear clustering and classification techniques, based on recently developed concepts in information the ory, Mercer kernel theory and graph spectral theory. 
Intelligent data analysis deals with the automatic detection of linear and non-linear patterns in data, and is an important research topic in machine learning and artificial intelligence. It also plays  an important role in other areas of research, such as e.g. bioinformatics, remote sensing, text categorization, image analysis and web retrieval. 
Mercer kernel methods are considered the current state-of-the-art of machine learning, enabling  classifica tion, clustering, correlation and ranking to be done in a non-linear feature space. In addition, graph spectral methods are also emerging rapidly, and have proved to be very useful, especially in data clustering.
The project will focus on theoretical issu es as well as application potential of a new information theoretic approach to machine learning, which is based on recent information theoretic cost functions and non-parametric estimation of probability density functions. This approach has been shown to be closely linked to kernel methods and graph spectral methods, but is in some sense much more intuitive. It also has the advantage of providing more apparent procedures with respect to the selection of system parameters. All together, this provides us ne w tools for a better mathematical understanding, and for developing better algorithms. It even opens avenues for fusing together the best parts of the above mentioned related research areas, which to date have been considered separate fields. 
The project  will lead to new and powerful information theoretic machine learning algorithms for intelligent data analysis, which will be aimed at operational use in applied areas such as remote sensing and bioinformatics.",Universiteter,UoH-sektor,2493000,Robert Jenssen,Institutt for fysikk og teknologi,Tromsø

185280,Developing and completing language resources: The Big Brother show as a modern speech corpus,2007,2008,"The project is designed to last for five months: August-December 2007. The goals for the project are to digitalize videos, time-code existing transcriptions, and transcribe hitherto un-transcribed parts of the hitherto unfinished Big Brother corpus. Furthermore, to make the new and transcribed, time-coded and annotated version into a new and complete corpus of the first  Norwegian Big Brother TV show. Finally, the corpus will be presented in a user-friendly web interface. 

The first series of the Norwegian Big Brother TV show will be a very important supplement to other speech corpora that are being planned and developed. It contains speech situations that are difficult or even impossible to get hold of with ordinary recording situations. The BB corpus will contain speech by people who interact in genuine ways, with a lot of accompanying emotional language. This contrasts sharply with other corpora, which usually contain speech by people in neutral conversations. 

The project will take as its starting point a largely unfinished version of a corpus of the BB show, finish   and which needs further transcription, a task which can be performed within a few autumn months. The existing, unfinished corpus is further described in 2.3.3.1. 
Part of the Big Brother Corpus is already available on the Internet in a web-based search interface, for research and development. However, previous lack of funding means that only half of it is transcribed and digitalized, and part of the transcribed material is not time-coded. With the present project, we plan to finish the transcription, digitalization and time-coding, as well as present it in an advanced search interface for linguistic and sociolinguistic studies, as well as for language-technological purposes. In a futu re project, we will mark sections of the corpus as examples of central emotions (described in 2.1). One trip to Copenhagen will be made, to discuss possible issues related to this at CST.
This application will enable us to make existing material (the un-transcribed material) available with the rest of the corpus. Transcribing it means building up new resources for researchers. A main project application to the Norwegian Research Council, to be sent next year, will have a better basis after this project. The project will be useful for the description of the Norwegian and Scandinavian languages, language technology, artificial intelligence and psychology. The result will be made available for a future Norsk Språkbank (Norwegian Language Bank).

191804,"MULTI-TEMPORAL SAR IMAGE ANALYSIS
Robust surface change detection and time series analysis of SAR and POLSAR images",2009,2012,"This project intend to develop advanced signal processing and information retrieval approaches for temporal analysis of SAR and POLSAR data, which can result in robust change detection and trend analysis algorithms. Within this research area, we will  focus on two important aspects; namely multi-class surface cover classication, and the detection and measurement of temporal change. The application areas will be related to surveillance of dynamic trends of northern land and ice (also snow covered) sur faces. The research is divided into three work packages; WP1: Data acquisition and pre-processing. WP2: Statistical modeling. WP3: Feature extraction and machine learning. In WP1 all relevant ground truth and existing SAR data will be collected, prepro cessed and organized into time series. Plans for further satellite and ground truth 
data acquisition will be made and carried out. In WP2 physical and statistical modeling of SAR/POLSAR data will be further developed. The idea is to extract texture feat ures, which together with features derrived from target decompsition methods, will enhance the classi?cation capabilities, and enable improved change detection and trend analysis. In WP3 analysis strategies and algorithms rooted in information theoretic and statistical learning theory will be developed and adapted to multidimensional SAR data.

193265,Next Generation Robotics for Norwegian Industry,2009,2015,"The proposed project will develop fundamentals, competence and leading-edge technologies within robotics to enable the introduction of advanced robotic solutions in specific Norwegian production processes. In particular, the project will target production  tasks that today are manually operated, and where robotic solutions are believed to give substantial economic effect and yield a considerable reduction of production costs. As expected, automation of these tasks will eliminate the need for repetitive man ual work improving safety of personnel as well as quality of products and services. It is a key step to increase the international competitiveness of the industrial partners. The project will start out from a set of challenging cases identified by the ind ustrial partners that involve contact/assembly manipulation in uncertain and unstructured environments. By attacking several cases in parallel the project will build the necessary competence and develop generic methods that are relevant for a wide spectru m of similar applications. 
These tasks are expected to be performed in demanding and uncertain environments, in presence of several another active and moving objects/obstacles in a working area and under the requirement of real time interaction. Such ope rations inherently possess many challenges for developing a system capable to substitute a human.  Various innovative contributions in subjects of motion planning, feedback control, signal processing, instrumentation, sensor fusion, robot perception and l earning as well as system integration are to meet in one place. The project addresses the collective technology and competence gaps faced by the industrial partners in these areas.

203461,The Certus Centre,2011,2019,"In spite of large investments in verification and validation (V&V) activities, we frequently read about serious software failures in the press. A 2010 example is that Toyota had to recall about 130,000 of its Prius hybrid vehicles and 10,000 Lexus cars in  the U.S. because the braking system software did not function correctly. 

In response to the continually increasing demand for dependable systems and ways to bring software V&V costs under control, we intend to create the leading research and innovation  centre on software V&V in Europe. In this centre, hosted by Simula Research Laboratory, research-intensive enterprises and world-leading research groups will join forces and develop new, industry-strength technology for V&V. Building a centre where the software industry collaboratively develops and exchanges state-of-the-art knowledge and technology within V&V is to the shared benefit of the Norwegian software-intensive industry and society since: (1) most organizations cannot afford to build comprehensive V&V competence on their own, (2) the centre's partners include major players in the public and private sectors who are already on a good level within software V&V.

In the Certus Centre, we will aim at innovations related to both technical and managerial aspects of software V&V. On the technical side, we will focus on V&V analysis activities, such as requirements quality assurance, and software testing. On the managerial side, we will focus on planning and trade-off analyses of V&V activities, such as  the trade-offs between software dependability, software cost and project completion time. The research will focus on fundamental and complex challenges that are important for society at large. Main research challenges include the development of scalable V&V technology and project management based on evidence about the relationship between V&V effort and software dependability.",Øvrige forskningsinstitutter,Instituttsektor,78399933,Arnaud Gotlieb,SIMULA RESEARCH LABORATORY AS,Bærum
205563,Autonomous Vehicle-Manipulator Systems Intelligent Operation of Remotely Located Facilities,2011,2014,"The project aims at developing solutions for autonomous operation of distant fields using robotic manipulators mounted on a moving vehicle. More specifically, the project will study the potential of vehicle-manipulator systems when it comes to intelligent  operation of remotely located fields that are not directly operated by humans. This may include subsea installations, operation in the arctic or antarctic, or operation in outer space. 

Firstly, modeling and control of vehicle-manipulator systems will b e addressed. This is a challenging topic due to the free-moving base and the formalism used for standard fixed-base manipulators cannot be applied directly. As a result a new set of control and motion planning algorithms that are designed especially for v ehicle-manipulator systems need to be developed. 

Secondly, the project aims at developing solutions for intelligent and autonomous operation of these fields when a human operator is not directly involved in the control. Using approaches from machine lea rning and artificial intelligence the project aims at developing new algorithms that are especially suited for vehicle-manipulator systems. These systems are special in the sense that they do not only allow for observation and monitoring of the process, b ut also actively intervening with the process. This requires a new set of algorithms that combine the observation/monitoring and the operation of the platform, including physically intervening with the process.",Universiteter,UoH-sektor,3449000,Pål Johan From,Institutt for matematiske realfag og teknologi,Ås

210031,Teknologiske og operasjonelle muligheter for bruk av AUV innen havbruk,2011,2011,"Hovedmålet for forprosjektet er å etablere et sterkt konsortium med vekt på kunnskap innen havbruk og AUV, og utarbeide en fullstendig BIP hovedprosjektsøknad til MAROFF. Videre er målsetningen for hovedprosjektet å utvikle en AUV demonstrator med tilhøre nde instrumentering for inspeksjon og produksjonskontroll i merdbaserte oppdrettsanlegg. Visjonen med arbeidet sikter mot å se på mulighetene for å utvikle et konsept som skal kunne anvendes kommersielt i oppdrett, samt kunne brukes som et forskningsverkt øy.
Størrelsen på anleggene som brukes innenfor oppdrett har utviklet seg betydelig sammen med økende produksjon. Trenden er stadig større merder og lokaliteter som plasseres i mer eksponerte områder. Det er derfor nødvendig med nye systemer for instrumen tering og prosessdokumentasjon for å kvantifisere produksjon og sikkerhet, noe som er motivert av både miljø og økonomi. Det er ønskelig å oppnå større kontroll på parametre knyttet bl.a. til rømningssikkerhet, fiskevelferd og vekstvilkår. 

En AUV utstyr t med relevante sensorsystemer kan brukes til å løse mange av disse ufordringene, og der et av de viktigste argumentene er fleksibilitet. Målingene kan hentes inn fra hele vannvolumet i et stort antall punkter, og fleksibiliteten og oppløsningen vil derfo r være vesentlig utvidet sammenlignet med tradisjonelle stasjonære målesystemer. En AUV kan programmeres til å utføre disse målingene periodisk, og ved hjelp av kunstig intelligens kan f.eks. detekterte problemområder undersøkes ekstra nøye. Data kan vide re brukes i beslutningsstøttesystemet for å optimalisere drift og operasjon av anlegget, og vil gi en helt ny grad av kontroll og oppfølging av produksjonen. 

Vi har tro på at det er mulig å løse disse oppgavene ved bruk av AUV, men samtidig vil det være  en rekke utfordringer ved å håndtere slik teknologi i et miljø med levende fisk og sårbare strukturer. Det vil derfor være mange interessante forsknings- og utviklingsoppgaver knyttet til et slikt prosjekt.",Næringsliv,Næringsliv,150000,Per Rundtop,AUV Department Kongsberg Maritime AS,Horten
210546,Identifisering av trykte objekter for sortering av retur,2011,2016,"Prosjektet fokuserer på effektive løsninger for automatisk retursortering gjennom identifikasjon av trykte objekter for to ulike anvendelser; sortering av trykksaker og sortering av drikkevareemballasje basert på etiketter. Begge problemstillingene stiller strenge krav til robusthet, nøyaktighet og effektivitet. Bildebasert gjenkjenning basert på lokale deskriptorer representerer et paradigmeskifte metodemessig som gir nye muligheter for å finne løsninger på disse sorteringsproblemene. Med utgangspunkt i  disse metodene er hensikten å utvikle et system for sortering av trykksaker. I tillegg skal de samme metodenes potensiale evalueres også for sortering av drikkevareemballasje samt juksutfordringer knyttet til dette. 

Innovasjonen består i å ta frem løsninger som gjør at systemene er mindre avhengige av strekkode. Det gir nye muligheter for håndtering av objekter der strekkoden mangler eller er ødelagt, men på sikt kan det også åpne for nye muligheter. For sortering av trykksaker kan det forenkle systemen e gjennom at det blir tilstrekkelig med avbildning fra en side, og det kan også øke funksjonaliteten ved å gjøre det mulig å håndtere bunker av like tidsskrifter. For drikkevareemballasje kan det gi nye muligheter for håndtering av fremtidens ikke-rotasjonssymmetriske objekter.

210723,Foundation Design of Tomorrow's Infrastructure,2011,2016,"The GeoFuture project proposes a 3-dimensional and integrated set of models to support civil engineering construction with geotechncial solutions. Under the leadership of NGI, Norwegian private companies, Norwegian universities and government agencies, the research will lead to an innovative way of solving geotechnical problems in an integrated manner with the structural, environmental and safety components of infrastructure projects.  

The future design approaches and tools for building, construction and transportation (Norwegian infrastructure) face an urgent need for integrated 3-D solutions combined with solid geo-expertise. The solutions will contribute to more effective and interdisciplinary design and even control of projects. A variety of techniques, ranging from artificial intelligence to computerized visualization, from new geotechnical models to methods and tools for risk assessment are the subject of the 4-year research.

214816,Common Language Resources and their Applications (CLARA),2011,2014,"In the past decades, language models have increasingly moved from manually constructed, deductive rule based systems towards systems based on statistics and machine learning of authentic data. The construction of such language models presupposes very larg e amounts of suitable, annotated language data for every language in question. Current approaches are often generally called ""corpus-based"" due to their reliance on text or speech corpora, but other, derived language resources such as lexicons, wordnets,  termbanks etc. play an important role as well. Even newer approaches are aimed at building hybrid models that include both rule-based and data-based knowledge sources, e.g. weighted finite-state transducers.
CLARA has interdisciplinary relevance. The project is primarily situated in the humanities, because the use of language sources, which are increasingly digitized, is pervasive in all humanities disciplines. CLARA will also have relevance for psychological and social science approaches to language incl uding the study of mental language processes and social dynamics of language groups. The project is also relevant beyond the Humanities and Social Sciences, since the traditional language sciences must be complemented by relevant knowledge from informatio n theory, statistics, computer science, cognitive science and artificial intelligence, to name just a few. Thus, the next generation of language researchers will need a new combination of training components which most universities and research institutio ns cannot offer by themselves.
The technological applications of CLARA are intersectoral. Language models have, for instance, a huge potential in the educational sector, which currently faces the gap between advanced research in Intelligent Computer-Assis ted Language Learning (ICALL) and the actual needs and practice of current Foreign Language Teaching (FLT). In the IT sector, localization, search engines and information retrieval constitute huge application area",Vitenskapelige høyskoler,UoH-sektor,444000,Gisle Andersen,Institutt for fagspråk og interkulturell kommunikasjon,Bergen
216801,Online-learning Intrusion Detection Systems (OL-IDS),2012,2013,"Massive data, adversarial activities, changing environments and lack of real labeled training datasets are challenging the successful protection of computer systems and networks by means of IDSs. Solving these problems guarantees the efficiency and effect iveness of IDSs and thus contributes to providing secure network systems. Expert systems, such as SNORT [1], are unable to deal with massive data and adversaries, since in these systems, manual coding of attack patterns costs a lot of effort and time. Moreover, the systems are often easy targets of evasion and obfuscation activities. Existing computational-intelligence-based IDSs with offline-learning algorithms require frequent complete o²ine re-training to improve the attack analysis and to learn new at tacks. When the training dataset is very large, these IDSs become impractical to adapt to dynamic environments. Furthermore, the training process requires a real labeled dataset that is diffcult to obtain due to privacy and labeling methodology issues.

217768,A Flexible and Common Control Architecture for Rolls-royce Marine Cranes and Robotic Arms,2012,2013,"Cranes are widely used to handle and transfer objects from large container ships to smaller lighters or to the quays of the harbors. The control of robotic cranes is always a challenging task which involves many problems such as load sway, positioning acc uracy, suppression, collision avoidance, and manipulation security. However, the low control flexibility and non-standardization are two crucial points of current crane control architecture. There is no standardized uniform control input interface or flex ible and common control architecture to deal with all possible cranes with different kinematics even if the cranes are from the same industrial maritime company. As a result, experienced human operators are only good at controlling some types of cranes ev en after many years of training. If operators have to control other crane systems, more professional training is absolutely necessary in order to get familiar with using the new input device with the different control strategy.
Rolls-Royce Marine has a la rge number of different types of cranes and robotic systems for handling cargoes and operations. The proposed project will address to develop a flexible control architecture and a common haptic device for all different Rolls-Royce marine deck cranes/robot s offering working efficiency and manipulation safety in marine operations. 
The project will therefore be a unique and it will strengthen the maritime cluster in the region and nationally. This project will combine expertise from complementary discipline s: robotics, artificial intelligence, computer science, and maritime industry.

217769,A Novel Integrated Anti-sway System for Rolls-Royce Marine Shipboard Cranes,2012,2013,"The proposed project will address the development of a novel anti-sway control architecture for different Rolls-Royce marine shipboard cranes, offering stability, safety, and efficiency during lifting, handling, transportation, and other manipulation.
Fir st, some systems in related literature are only designed to reduce pendulation, while others only focus on minimizing wave impact on the payload by reducing dynamic forces. However, to the best of our knowledge, to date, no integrated solutions to prevent  both these problems have been presented. From a technical point of view, the proposed system will offer working efficiency and safety in marine operations. It will reduce the crane payload swing in the roll and pitch directions of the ship using a modifi ed variable bang-bang controller. Meanwhile, the system could minimize wave impact on the payload by reducing the dynamic forces in the hoist wire using sensor feedback and hydraulic damper. As far as we are aware, there are no similar crane control appro aches available to date in Norway, nor in Europe or in the US to provide the anti-sway control functions dealing with the pendulation of long hoist cable and effects from the sea waves at the same time. 
All proposed control strategy will not only be demo nstrated in the simulated environment but will also be implemented as a real physical prototype for controlling Rolls-Royce shipboard cranes. Given its interdisciplinary nature, this project has to combine expertise from complementary disciplines: robotic s, artificial intelligence, computer science, and the maritime industry. All research results will not only affect maritime application but are also expected to lead to fundamentally new control systems based on dynamic control, and multifunctional system s in the robotics and automation field.

222415,The embodied cognitive bases for classifier systems,2013,2017,"This project looks at the possibility that abstract grammatical categories as they are expressed in classifier systems of nouns are instances of embodied conceptual knowledge. Such categories typically describe the noun's essence  (an ANIMAL dog), its phy sical properties (a LONG pencil, a FLEXIBLE rope), or its function (a VEHICLE car). ""Embodied"" means that concepts are stored and reactivated in modal brain areas corresponding to the senses that were active in the process of learning: through vision, tou ch, taste, physical interaction or emotion, or a combination of these. Modal knowledge is processed locally in disparate brain areas, e.g. visual knowledge quite distant from areas for moving one's body parts. Knowing this, the first challenge regards how  co-occurring modes of learning are merged in the brain to form unitary concepts. Is there a central abstraction area in the brain that after learning stores concepts irrespective of the manner in which they were learnt? If so, what function does reactiva tion of neurons in modal areas have for processing concepts? is it redundant or crucial for understanding? The project also looks at the contribution of shape, motion and emotion in knowing about living vs. non-living things. Evidence from grammars and br ain-damaged patients have independently shown that this notion is gradient (human > animal, etc). Neuroimaging evidence on these categories will reveal what brain areas support their knowledge and increase understanding of meaning-impairment. Likewise, th e importance of understanding a central vs. distributed representation of knowledge will affect how we think about treatments for knowledge- and language disabled people, since we will understand better the importance of manner of learning for subsequent  storage. It will also prove or disprove embodied cognition as a theory applying equally to abstract and concrete concepts. Finally, interactional knowledge systems are relevant to programming in robotics.",Universiteter,UoH-sektor,3583000,Marit Lobben,Psykologisk institutt,Oslo

It is NEALT (Northern European Association for Language Technology) that has asked Professor Janne  Bondi Johannessenthe and University of Oslo, Department of Linguistics and Scandinavian Studies to organize the conference in 2013.

The main theme is language technology in many different forms, such as speech recognition and speech synthesis, tagging a nd parsing, language modeling, machine learning, machine translation, man-machine interaction, automatic summarisation, and information retrieval. Language technology is a new and exciting field that also has practical benefits for society, such as in app lications like spell checkers, search engines on the Internet, automatic translation on the Internet, aids for disabled and the visually impaired, etc.
 
NODALIDA is especially important for the participating countries because it brings together participa nts from small northern European language communities. These have common challenges compared to the worldwide English- or Spanish-speaking communities. Language technology is expensive to develop whether the language community is large or small. For small  languages the market potential for language technology products is often too small to be commercially profitable.

NODALIDA is thus an important conference, because it makes it possible to focus on challenges related to Norwegian and Nordic languages,  a nd to Sami, Kven and Finnish. At the same time the quality of the conference is high, so that both talks and posters are important sources of new knowledge for the participants. (Approx 67% of the submissions are accepted.)

The conference lasts for two d ays and will be a mix of plenary lectures, lectures in parallel sessions (usually three) and a poster and demonstration session. The first day is the day for workshops.",Universiteter,UoH-sektor,94000,Janne M. Bondi Johannessen,DET HUMANISTISKE FAKULTET,Oslo
222718,"Integrated Environmental Monitoring;
taking environmental data in to decision making processes",2012,2016,"The project consists of the four following parts: 

Part 1 Automatic image analysis and machine learning
Main Aim: For proper analysis and use of pictures, there is a need for a system to help humans to pinpoint/select issues of interest to be further inv estigated. This could be 1) specific objects of interest, e.g. coverage of corals or leaks of hydrocarbons or 2) changes in patterns of vast amount of data on one geographical location e.g. gradually present or absent of specific species. 

Part 2 Combini ng multi sensor data for optimal benefit of information 
Main Aim: is to use one or several of the identified case studies in the IEM project and the AUR-LAB cruises to identify which key-environmental variables and parameters that should be measured in g iven situations (1-3 described below), and use multivariate analysis to interpret the results with respect to the source for observed change and the co-variance between variables and parameters. 

Part 3 How to use processed data into a decision making pr ocesses?
Main Aim: The focus in this part will be on finding the optimal way of presenting the data types, or a set of these, described in part 1 and 2. Furthermore, as basis for environmental management the aim is to identify what kind of data different  decision makers needs and if some of the data need to be shared between the different decision makers. 

Part 4 Piloting process
Main Aim: The focus in this part is to apply Part 1-3 on an actual offshore case. This part will also be a validation of the s olutions chosen in part 1-3. The pilot will be specified by the IEM project. 


I addition to reflecting key issues identified as success factors in the IEM project, it is also believed that the different parts will give valid knowledge and experiences on  how to optimise and use environmental data in management in general.",Næringsliv,Næringsliv,1416000,Vidar Hepsø,EQUINOR ASA,Stavanger
223262,Centre for Neural Computation (CNC),2013,2022,"English version
The most challenging goal of neuroscience is to understand how subjective experience arises out of distributed electrical activity in the brain. Neuroscientists have uncovered striking correlations between behaviour and neural activity but the distributed and interleaved nature of neural representations has prevented insight into the underlying computational operations. The Centre of Excellence (CoE) scheme of the Research Council of Norway (RCN) provides a one-time opportunity to set up a research programme of the magnitude and continuance required to identify these mechanisms. I propose to develop the Centre for Neural Computation (CNC) to pioneer the extraction of computational algorithms from the mammalian cortex. We shall use our recent discovery of grid cells as an access ramp. Because the matrix-like firing of these cells is generated within the brain, independently of specific sensory features, grid cells provide unprecedented access to coding in high-end cortices. I have assembled an expert team that comes together at CNC to decipher the fundamental codes of the space circuit - the mechanisms by which signals from grid cells and other cells are generated, transformed, stored and retrieved by local and global network operations. The timing would be optimal because a wide spectrum of large-scale cell type-specific recording technologies will become available through NORBRAIN, an RCN-funded national infrastructure that less than 6 months after its opening is emerging as one of the world's largest assemblies of equipment for advanced neural circuit analysis. The research plan will be accompanied by the foundation of a national research school and the first PhD programme on neural circuits in Norway. The consequences of understanding the brain at the algorithmic level are diverse and far-reaching, spanning from the diagnosis and prevention of a wide range of neurological and psychiatric diseases to the implementation of brain algorithms in tomorrow's computers.

En av de største utfordringene i moderne nevrovitenskap er å finne ut hvordan subjektiv erfaring oppstår ut fra elektrisk aktivitet i hjernen. Hjerneforskere har oppdaget slående korrelasjoner mellom atferd og nevral aktivitet men fordi nevrale representasjoner er distribuerte, har det vært vanskelig å oppnå innsikt i de underliggende beregningsoperasjonene. Forskningsrådets ordning for Fremragende Forskning representerer en unik anledning til å sette opp et forskningsprogram med den størrelse og varighet som trengs for å idenfisere slike mekanismer. Vi foreslår å opprette Centre for Neural Computation (CNC) for å lede an i avdekkingen av nevrale algoritmer i hjernebarken til pattedyr. Som innfallsport vil vi bruke gittercellene i entorhinal cortex, som vi oppdaget i 2005. Gitterceller er på mange måter målestokken i hjernens kartsystem. Fordi gittercellenes matriselignende aktivitetsmønster genereres inne i hjernen, uavhengig av innkommende sensoriske signaler, gir disse cellene oss en unik anledning til å beskrive prinsipper for nevral koding i høyere-ordens assosiasjons-hjernebark. Vi har samlet en gruppe eksperter for å identifisere de fundamentale kodene i hjernens kartsystem og for å avsløre mekanismene for dannelse og omdannelse av gitterceller og andre celler ved hjelp av lokale og globale nettverksoperasjoner. Tidspunktet for opprettelsen av et slikt senter er optimalt siden et vidt spektrum av storskala celletype-spesifikke registreringsteknologier har blitt tilgjengeliggjort gjennom NORBRAIN, en Forskningsrådsfinansiert nasjonal infrastruktur som 6 måneder etter innvielsen framstår som en av verdens største samlinger av utstyr for avansert nevral nettverksanalyse. Forskningsplanen ledsages av etableringen av en nasjonal forskerskole og det første PhD-programmet for nevrale kretser og nevral nettverksberegning i Norge. Implikasjonene av å forstå hjernen på et algoritmisk nivå er vidtrekkende og spenner fra tidlig diagnose og behandling av en rekke nevrologiske og psykiatriske sykdommer til utvikling av hjerne-computer-grensesnitt og implementering av nevrale algoritmer i fremtidens datamaskiner.",Universiteter,UoH-sektor,175000000,May-Britt Moser,NTNU FAKULTET FOR MEDISIN OG HELSEVITENSKAP,Trondheim
225917,Integration of Computational Fluid Dynamics(CFD) and Meteorological Modelling Techniques to Optimize Wind Farm Performance,2013,2014,"The aim of this project is to improve the wind farm performance in the operational phase by accurate predictions of wind turbine production and loading. Accurate wind characteristics on the turbine scale is the key challange, it will be determined by inte grating mesoscale and microscale models.

Recent improvements in both mesoscale meteorological models and microscale models based on Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) make a tighter integration possible. The improvements includes better description of th e flow stratification and turbulence, along with better compatibility of the boundary conditions - the difference in scales between meso and micro models has simply been reduced during the years.

In a forecast situation the accuracy of a CFD simulation w ill heavily depend on the input from the mesoscale. In areas with complex terrain the accuracy is expected to be of a poor quality. In such cases it is necessary to recognize the salient processes underling the forecast error and improve the accuracy of t he mesoscale model before running the microscale fluid dynamics model.

To further improve on the accuracy machine learning techniques will be used. A new mesoscale-microscale coupling model is proposed: trained on historical observations, the model uses  mesoscale forecast output to issue a high quality site-specific forecast which will be used to scale the CFD modelling of the flow at the site.

The outcome will be wind farm simulations more representative of local terrain conditions than usual idealized  problems considering a wider range of stratification regimes and their individual effects accounted for in wind farm optimization procedures.",Næringsliv,Næringsliv,3791000,Catherine Meissner,WINDSIM AS,Tønsberg

The project takes as starting point the last decades developments of fuel cell and membrane materials in RCN and EU projects by the partners and by startup companies around these, and moves into the next stage of scientific and technological  understanding that may lead to enhanced performance and lifetime. These are based on the application of recent theory of charged core regions and space charge layers of interfaces like grain boundaries, and extending it to surfaces and electrodes, while a t the same time taking into use the wide range of atomic resolution microscopy and advanced spectroscopy that have become available at large facilities and national research infrastructures. Moreover, the project takes advantage of supercomputer facilitie s and partner proven expertise to model the same interfaces at an unprecedented level. Cation diffusivity in bulk and grain boundary as well as thermomechanical degradation will be measured and used to predict and improve lifetime with support from measur ement of mechanical properties.

228620,Mixing Artificial Intelligence and Social Science Methods: Quantifying Stakeholder Perceptions and Vulnerabilities to Climate Change,2013,2014,"Anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations are rising and, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (2007) it is probable that this rise is responsible for the increase in global temperature over the past fifty years. 

Vulnerability to temperature rise has different implications in different areas as levels of exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity vary. However, there appears to be a consistent lack of action from stakeholders in response to temperature rise despite their k nowledge of this occurring (and projections that it will continue). Adaptation and mitigation to climate change, climate variability and extreme events consists of a very broad range of responses, all of which will have different political implications. 
 
A.I. CLIMATE will address this issue, and create baselines for further exploration through a network of internationally renowned scientists from Norway, Sweden, Canada, Australia and the USA participating in a three-day workshop in Norway, one of which o bjectives is to comment and critique on the mix of methodologies from several disciplines and establish new and improved methodological and theoretical baselines for future studies. The methodological mix brings in data from marine chemistry (climatic and  non-climatic stressors), Political Science (systems thinking and Baysian Belief Networks), Engineering/Modelling (iPad compatibility programming), Economics (Trade off analysis) and Computer Science (Artificial Intelligence and Opinion Mining). 

A.I.

230338,Programmable epigenetics (Epi++) - exploiting anchoring non-coding RNAs for targeted epigenetic reprogramming,2014,2020,"During normal replication of the chromosomes, DNA and epigenetic modifications in DNA and histones are copied to daughter cells and this process is vital for maintaining cell identity and proper cell function. Although we have good models for how cells co py DNA methylations, the exact mechanisms of how histone modifications are transferred from one cell generation to the next remain elusive. Consequently, today this process cannot be manipulated for targeted epigenetic reprogramming.

In Epi++, I aim to d evelop a method that manipulates the process of epigenetic inheritance between human mother and daughter cells to reprogram the cells' epigenetic state. Central to this method will be a computational model that identifies non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) that are  essential in maintaining histone modifications and that predicts the regulatory targets of these ""anchor RNAs"". To develop the computational model, we will use a multi-disciplinary approach that combines high throughput genomics in replicating cells, bio informatics, machine learning, and RNA interference to identify, characterize, and validate such anchor RNAs.

By addressing one of the important open questions in epigenetics: ""how are histone modifications maintained during DNA replication?"" Epi++ will  open new, major research possibilities in at least three separate areas. First, the computational model can be used to assign potential functions and thereby guide future experiments on the plethora of recently identified ncRNAs. Second, the model will en able future research on genetic variation that affect epigenetic inheritance and thereby cause disease. Third, the model will set the trend for programmable epigenetics as tool within mammalian biotechnology and human therapeutics. In summary, Epi++ will  likely have a high impact on future epigenetics research.",Universiteter,UoH-sektor,3292000,Pål Sætrom,Institutt for datateknologi og informatikk,Trondheim
231395,Diagnostic support system development for the monitoring of psychosis,2014,2019,"Current best practice in assessing psychiatric clinical states relies on frequent clinical interviews with trained professionals. However, there are not enough clinicians to monitor patients as often as necessary, and relapse or suicide can follow even a  few days after a clinician-patient meeting, highlighting the limits of intermittent clinical evaluation. Emerging technologies can automatically track and transmit key patient data, including information about affect, activation level, and suicidal ideati on, and generate alerts to initiate human intervention. Data capture can be inobtrusive (e.g., wristband monitors and smartphones). Body movement and non-verbal aspects of speech can form robust indicators of psychomotor activation and affect, while autom atic content analysis of speech can detect morbid ideation and changes in symptoms of depression and schizophrenia. We propose to assemble a remote monitoring system from currently available state-of-the-art technical elements, configure them to capture a nd transmit both passive-continuous and elicited-episodic data streams from outpatients. The goal is to implement a system that tracks the psychological state of psychiatric outpatients and when appropriate generates alerts that indicate that clinical sta ff should initiate communication with that patient. The potential to predict relapse risk before it occurs can avoid many medical crises and suicide-attempts/suicides. The research program is designed to answer three questions about the feasibility of rem ote monitoring of such patients: (i) Can available technology be configured to support such monitoring with sufficient accuracy to be useful? (ii) Will some portion of the outpatient psychiatric population tolerate such monitoring and comply with its beha vioral requirements?

Our software has been successfully demonstrated to work in catalyst discovery and has the poten tial to boost development of new and more efficient absorbent molecules that are also cheap and easy to synthesize.

Our method is based on an evolutionary algorithm (EA), a global optimization method ensuring that absorbents with optimal properties are r eached. New structures are automatically assembled and evaluated by one or several fitness functions, which are here directly related to the observed absorption of CO2 or to theoretically computed properties highly correlated with observations. Central to  the method is the development of fitness functions based on highly predictive quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) models to make the iterative evolutionary algorithm computationally tractable. 

The success of the proposed de novo method  could be a game-changer for carbon capture as it enables considerable speed-up of the development process and gives cheaper and better absorbent molecules.

234122,Condition monitoring tool for separators based on combined use of tracer technology and multiphase flow modeling,2014,2018,"A condition monitoring tool for measuring liquid carry-over from separators and scrubbers will be developed and tested. Controlling liquid carry over is essential for operation of equipment downstream of separators and scrubbers as, for example, compressors, are intolerant to large amount of liquids. Any liquid carried over has the potential to cause scale problems in process equipment causing decreased system performance and ultimately failure. Further, in gas transport lines following subsea separation,  hydrate formation is a concern, requiring reliable methods for monitoring separator performance. 
The proposed condition monitoring tool is based on the combined use of tracer technology and modeling of low liquid load multiphase flow. The tracing techni ques are focused on the use of short-lived radiotracers for water and oil provided by the method of radiotracer generators. The modeling of low liquid load multiphase flow will be developed concurrently with multiphase flow experiments at the IFE Well Flo w Loop, which will generate input parameters to the model. New experimental advances in X-ray tomography of thin films are an important task in the project.
The project's main delivery is a condition monitoring tool, enabling more accurate evaluation of l iquid carry-over. However, the condition monitoring tool itself is just a part of the deliveries from this project.  A new prescription for describing the entrainment process in high density, low liquid load systems contributes to the fundamental understa nding of multiphase flow, and may have implications for process equipment design.

Photo surveys in remote areas (the West Ice) are expensive and the  logistics have become increasingly difficult during the last years. The project aims to explore the use of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) operated from a survey vessel to photograph harp and hooded seal whelping areas. The photos will be analysed and model led using a mosaic method, which will give a total photographic coverage of the area and provides us with the opportunity to obtain a total number of seals in the covered area. Then we will explore how various sampling techniques, such as random sampling  and traditional aerial strip transect methods with different transect widths and various spatial coverage along transects will affect the quality of the estimates of the seal abundance. Manual analysis of the images is extremely time consuming and costly,  and involves subjective human interpretation by trained experts. This project aims at developing methodology for automating the process of counting seals from aerial images. This will be achieved through the development of new image analysis and pattern  recognition techniques tailored to detect seals in digital colour images. The project will also investigate the potential of thermal infrared sensors that extract temperature characteristics of the imaged objects. The result of the research will be knowle dge about how to apply an UAV to estimate the seal population sizes, and a set of algorithms for automatic and semi-automatic detection of seals in aerial images, leading to cost-effective abundance estimation of seal populations. This will further lead t o better long-term management of seal populations.

However, we are still far from a situation in which industries and pharmaceutical laboratories effectively design new  materials and medicines based on molecular modelling. Present simulations techniques can not reach the required system- and length scales that are required for complex chemical and biological processes or are based on inaccurate oversimplified models whi ch make them unreliable. This research proposal aims to realize the ultimate dream of every researcher in the field of molecular modelling: running efficient and accurate quantum based dynamics of chemical reactions without the necessity to develop a new  forcefield for each system which is painful and time-consuming process.  The method that we will develop is the dynamical equivalent of Quantum Mechanics-Molecular Mechanics (QM-MM). Just like in QM-MM we combine the best of both worlds, accurate quantum- based MD and fast classical MD simulations  using an initially standardly parameterized forcefield. However, whereas QM-MM is designed to obtain large system size with  QM accuracy, our method is designed to boost timescale, even beyond the point of strai ghtforward classical MD. The method is based on path sampling using the Replica Exchange Transition Interface algorithm (RETIS). This method allows for a very natural and exact approach to combine QM and classical potentials and update the classical force field parameters on-the-fly during the simulation. This method will crate an avalanche applications and scientific users since it allows to study an important category of processes, chemical reactions in a complex environment,  for which an efficient method is yet lacking.",Universiteter,UoH-sektor,12130000,Titus Sebastian van Erp,Institutt for kjemi,Trondheim

In the emerging era of big data, gaps in data increase exponentially, and manual handling is impossible, hence creating a big missing data problem. As a key solution, the KERNEO project will develop the next generation machine learning algorithms for big missing data as a game-changer in future knowledge extraction. This will be achieved by a highly novel approach whereby the versatility of kernel methods will be synergistically cross-fertilized by the probabilistic nature of information theoretic learning for big data latent (missing) variable analysis. Earth observation (EO), a field where missing data is extremely common e.g. due to clouds, and where data is big, will serve as the test bed for KERNEO, focusing in particular on tropical forest monitoring using the coming Sentinel satellites. In EO, ad-hoc solutions, like simply discarding missing values, are implemented in the analysis to handle cloud-contaminated images, thereby ignoring valuable information. The KERNEO next generation missing data machine learning tools, providing superior knowledge extraction on challenging missing data scenarios, will be highly innovative in EO monitoring and will moreover translate to scientific fields far beyond EO.

239963,Cortical representation of unrestrained whole-body motion in 3D,2015,2019,"A fundamental question in neuroscience is how volitional actions emerge from neural circuits in the brain. Answers to this and other 'big' questions will begin to unfurl in the 21st century thanks to improved data acquisition techniques which permit the sampling of hundreds to thousands of cells simultaneously. A looming problem, however, is that datasets will soon grow so large that a new generation of analytical tools will also be required.

The central aim of this project, to understand how parietal cortical ensemble activity maps onto the freely-behaving body, will make use of recent advances in markerless 3D motion tracking and large-scale in vivo calcium imaging in freely behaving mice. In order to analyze datasets of this scale, we will develop novel machine learning algorithms to correlate neuronal activity patterns with key movement features such as changes in joint angles.

The major goals of the project include the synchronization of neural and behavioral recordings from mice foraging in an open arena. Once sufficient data is collected, the next goal will be to implement 'deep belief' machine learning algorithms which will be trained to recognize patterns between the neural and behavioral datasets. To this end, we have the key advantage of collaborating with a field-leading expert in deep belief algorithms who focuses on modeling biological movement.

Finally, we will determine if we can apply our new tools to accurately foretell an animal's autonomously chosen trajectory when it is presented with a navigational goal. By imaging neural activity during a variety of behaviors, we aim to make a quantum leap forward in understanding the cortical representation of a wide spectrum of whole-body movements which comprise an animal's waking behavior. The computational tools developed in the process could be applied to study any number of behaviors in wild-type or disease-model mice, and could even be applied in developing clinical neural prostheses.",Universiteter,UoH-sektor,7000000,Jonathan Whitlock,Kavliinstitutt for nevrovitenskap,Trondheim
240013,"MBT4CPS: Evolving, Modelling and Testing Realistic and Risky Uncertain Behaviours of Cyber-Physical Systems",2015,2018,"English Version:
Our daily life is increasingly relying on Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs). We can find such systems in many safety and mission-critical domains such as robotics, logistics, healthcare, aerospace, and maritime applications. Tackling uncertainty in CPSs at an acceptable cost is essential to prevent severe failures in real life. Ensuring that CPSs will provide correct behaviors in the presence of uncertainty, we need to demonstrate that CPSs achieve a satisfactory level of safety, security, and robustness at an acceptable cost. To ensure the quality of the systems, we need to develop cost-effective methods for verification and validation of CPSs such as based on systematic and automated model-based testing (MBT).
Our goal is to improve the dependability (e.g., security and robustness) of CPSs with cost-effective model and search-based testing methods with a particular focus on known and unknown risky uncertainty. Unknown uncertainty is the one risk factor that can only be observed during the real operation of a CPS as opposed to the ones that are known at the design time. The consequence of risky uncertainty will be unwanted circumstances leading to potentially hazardous situations. We will achieve our goal by advancing the current state-of-art by developing new solutions for testing Cyber-Physical Systems based on sound theoretical foundations in the following steps. First, we will develop a solution for minimalistic modeling of different types of known risky uncertainties. Second, we will develop methods to intelligently evolve known models towards realistic and risky unknown uncertainty models (evolved models) using search algorithms (e.g., genetic algorithms mimicking natural selection). Third, we will develop methods to automatically generate test cases from the evolved models to test a CPS under unknown uncertainty. With our solutions, we will ensure that the CPSs will continue to operate appropriately even in uncertainty and possibly at a reduced quality of operation, rather than to fail.

Vårt daglige liv er avhengig av Cyber-Fysiske Systemer (CFS-er) i økende grad. Vi kan finne slike systemer i mange sikkerhets- og samfunnskritiske domener som roboter, logistikk, helsetjenester, luftfart og sjøfart. Det er essensielt å håndtere usikkerhet i CFS-er til en akseptabel kostnad hvis man skal forhindre katastrofale feil i det virkelige liv. For å sikre at CFS-er vil oppføre seg korrekt i møte med usikkerheter må vi demonstrere at systemene kan være tilfredsstillende trygge, sikre og robuste, til en akseptabel kostnad. For å sikre denne kvaliteten må vi utvikle kostnadseffektive metoder for å verifisere og validere CFS-er, slik som metoden basert på systematisk, modellbasert testing (MBT).
Målet er å forbedre påliteligheten (sikkerheten og robustheten) til CFS-ene med kostnadseffektive modellbaserte testmetoder som spesielt tar for seg kjente og ukjente uforutsigbarheter. Ukjente uforutsigbarheter er den ene risikofaktoren som bare kan observeres under virkelige kjøringer av Cyber-Fysiske Systemer, i motsetning til de uforutsigbarhetene som er kjent ved utviklingsstadiet. Konsekvensen av risikable uforutsigbarheter er at uønskede omstendigheter fører til potensielt farlige situasjoner. Vi ønsker å nå målet vårt ved å videreutvikle dagens forskning og utvikle nye løsninger for å teste CFS-er basert på et solid teoretisk grunnlag. Først vil vi utvikle en løsning for minimalistisk modellering av ulike typer risikable uforutsigbarheter. Deretter vil vi utvikle metoder for intelligent evolusjon av kjente modeller mot realistiske og risikable ukjente usikkerhetsmodeller (utviklede modeller) ved å bruke søkealgoritmer som minner om naturlig utvalg. Det tredje steget går ut på å utvikle metoder som automatisk genererer eksempeltester fra de utviklede modellene for å teste en CFS for ukjente uforutsigbarheter. Med våre løsninger skal vi sikre at CFS-ene vil fortsette å være i korrekt drift selv om de skulle møte på uforutsigbarheter. Systemene vil muligens kjøre med redusert kapasitet, men driftsstans kommer ikke til å inntreffe i møte med risiko.",Øvrige forskningsinstitutter,Instituttsektor,7232000,Shaukat Ali,SIMULA RESEARCH LABORATORY AS,Bærum
240024,Interactive and Optimal Configuration of Cyber Physical System Product Lines,2015,2020,"The current practice of manually configuring any non-trivial Cyber Physical Systems (CPSs) product line is often error-prone and labor-intensive. In other words, the quality and productivity of the product configuration process cannot be ensured. In critical domains (e.g., oil and gas), poor quality and low efficient services provided by CPSs (e.g., subsea production systems) will cause severe issues (e.g., oil or gas leaks to the sea). 

In this project, we aim to improve the quality and productivity of configuring large-scale CPSs. Correctly configured products in CPSs are often directly deployable and operational systems. The method we take is to apply Model Based Engineering (MBE) technologies to automate the configuration process of Product Line Engineering (PLE) to the maximum extent. Effectiveness of a PLE approach for CPSs is characterised by its support for abstraction and automation. Abstraction plays a central role in software reuse, which is required to capture all relevant information in a concise and expressive manner to support automated configuration of products. Automation is required for effective selection and customisation of reusable components. 

We will propose in this project an interactive and optimal configuration solution (with tool support named as Zen-Configurator) with three key functionalities implemented: Decision Inference, Decision Ordering and Consistency Checking. In literature, it does not exist a configuration solution that supports all these functionalities in an integrated manner with a user acceptable performance. To address this R&D challenge, we will base our solution on the theoretical foundation including: 1) cost-effective optimisation for supporting decision ordering, 2) optimised constraint solving to enable decision inference, 3) effective formalisation of consistency checking, and 4) novel algorithms to enable the three functionalities with user acceptable performance.",Øvrige forskningsinstitutter,Instituttsektor,7000000,Tao Yue,SIMULA RESEARCH LABORATORY AS,Bærum

240282,Atomic Units for Language Universal representation of Speech,2015,2020,"Traditional speech recognition systems are based on a top-down approach where the sub-word units are pre-defined, usually on the basis of linguistic theory. In order to build robust statistical models of these units, massive amounts of data is required.  Yet, this approach is sensitive to mismatch between the imposed model and real-world data at all levels. The recognition problem is framed as finding the most likely sequence of units that match a legal sequence of words, as defined by the lexicon and the language model. 
Instead of relying on top-down decoding, we propose a paradigm based on bottom-up detection and information extraction. Instead of learning statistical models of pre-defined units, we aim at developing an approach to ASR that is based on learning the 'optimal' set of units that can be used to map from variable acoustic data to invariable meaningful symbols in a bottom-up information extraction procedure. These units must capture the structure in the speech signals that are imposed by the constraints of the articulatory system, i.e., the structure that encodes the linguistic information. At the same time, the units must be flexible and adaptive, so that they can be used for understanding unknown speakers in arbitrary acoustic backgrounds. Last but not least, it must be possible to learn the units from limited amounts of annotated speech.
The core paradigm will be investigated through exploring and verifying five supporting hypotheses:
- The salient information of the speech signal can be represented by detecting a small number of acoustic-phonetic events.
- The set of sub-word units can be discovered from the detected events by machine learning approaches.
- The relationship between sub-word units and linguistic units can be learnt from (possibly labeled) data.
- The dependence of language and speaker on the sub-word units will be explored through employing them for automatic language identification and for speaker recognition.",Universiteter,UoH-sektor,8411000,Torbjørn Svendsen,Institutt for elektroniske systemer,Trondheim
240663,Quantifying Soil Structure to Augment the Relevance of Laboratory-Based Soil Hydraulic Properties for Environmental Modelling,2015,2020,"Successful simulation-based environmental studies and relevant mapping applications rely on accurate predictions of soil hydraulic parameters from readily available soil properties. Progress in the latter area has been stagnant for at least 10 years - the base data used in such estimations has not changed much in over 30 years - which have compromised our ability to simulate environmentally relevant processes. This project has identified two reasons for this: (1) soil hydraulic properties measured in the laboratory poorly represent hydraulic properties at the field scale for reasons that are not yet well understood; and (2) conventional approaches to estimate soil hydraulic properties are primarily based on properties of the solid constituents of disturbed soil samples, while hydrological processes in the field are governed dominantly by the 3D void system of the undisturbed, structured soil. The aims of this project are to advance the scientific frontier on each of these identified areas by contributing to i) the understanding and quantification of 3D soil pore geometry; and ii) translating laboratory soil data into field-effective soil hydraulic properties. Existing international data as well as extensive dual-scale data collection campaigns will serve as the necessary soil data and validation on field moisture regime. Novel mathematical concepts, non-invasive geophysical measurements, and X-ray computed tomography imaging will be coupled with traditional measurements to generate the necessary data pool. Cutting edge machine learning tools will be used to quantify data relationships and the predictive power of the new types of data, and 2D/3D simulation modelling will be used to quantify the benefit from the new findings in the context of 2 selected field-sites, using existing and ongoing field data collection campaigns.

240862,Engineering Predictability with Embodied Cognition,2015,2020,"Humans are superior to computers and robots when it comes to applying multimodal sensing together with learned knowledge in choosing the best actions. This project aims at developing human-inspired self-models of the behaviour of humans and robots as well as their environment and show that these models have the ability to predict future actions in an accurate way. This is based on the concept from psychology and philosophy called embodied cognition proposing that the body plays an important part in intelligence. The goal is to develop effective reasoning models as an alternative to the more traditional reactive systems.

The novelty in this project is the design of self-models as well as combining these with predictive systems to accurately model behaviour and predict future actions and events. The models are to be applied in embedded systems and will be tested in the interdisciplinary fields of music and robotics where we expect significant breakthrough compared to state-of-the-art. This is by building on ideas stemming from our earlier work on addressing scalability through incremental approaches and hardware system design. Furthermore, the exploration of the systems in an interdisciplinary way is expected to contribute to groundbreaking results. The research in the project is divided into six work packages: (1) Sensing human motion and state, (2) Sensor data analysis, (3) Self-modeling with embodied cognition, (4) Predictive models, and one work package for each of the two use cases.

241277,Kriterier for strukturering av informasjon i helsevesenet - Sørlandet sykehus HF,2014,2020,"Det pågår en utvikling i helsevesenet, fra dokumentering i fritekst til at man i større grad dokumenterer strukturert informasjon. 

Flere systemleverandører utvikler for tiden neste generasjon PAS/EPJ-system som i større grad vil ha mulighet for å lagre strukturerte data som kan sammenstilles og presenteres på en måte som er tilpasset det enkelte helsepersonells situasjonsbestemte behov. Et eksempel her er DIPS-Arena for spesialisthelsetjenesten, som gjør bruk av openEHR-arketyper og templater/maler for å strukturere og presentere helseinformasjon. Det forventes at helseforetakene som bruker DIPS Classic i løpet av perioden 2015-2020 gradvis vil fase dette ut og ta i bruk DIPS Arena. Dette gjelder også for helseforetakene i Helse Sør-Øst, herunder Sørlandet sykehus.

Gjennom blant annet Stortingsmelding ""En innbygger, en journal"" fremkommer det at norske myndigheter vil satse mye på eHelse i årene som kommer. Denne satsningen skjer på bakgrunn av forventninger om betydelige gevinster. En viktig forutsetning for å kunne realisere dette er standardisering og strukturering av helseinformasjon slik at informasjonen blant annet kan kommuniseres effektivt og ha gjenbruksverdi for aktørene som samhandler.

Forskningslitteratur viser at det i en del tilfeller er et gap mellom postulerte og empirisk demonstrerte gevinster ved innføringen av nye teknologier i helsevesenet. Den viser også at helseinformasjon i varierende grad egner seg for strukturering, og en sentral utfordring fremover vil bli identifisering av helseinformasjon som egner seg for strukturering.

Selskapet utvikler finansielle modeller og formler for internasjonal handel for å optimalisere avkastning samtidig som teknologien også minimerer tap. Huddlestock vil automatisere mye av analysearbeidet i forhold til evalueringer og prissettinger av selskaper som i dag blir gjort manuelt av analytikere. Grunnet tilgang til såkalt ?big data? vil det være mulig å utvikle en finansiell teknologi som kan tillegges kunstig intelligens  for å bedre forstå og analyse bevegelsene til verdipapirer enn det som eksisterer i dag. 

Prosjektet vil kunne ha en større relevans for Eurostars og for de deltagende partnerne i forhold til markedet og klimaet for finans i 2000 tallet og utover. Intel ligente analyseverktøy vil gjøre det enklere for banker, institusjoner og andre å oppdage om det er utfordringer i finansindustrien som må tas tak i før det er for sent. Denne type analyser vil gjøre det mulig å være proaktiv i å forhindre slike utfordrin ger som har oppstått i forhold til overprisede finansinstrumenter og salg av gjeld som inneholder altfor høy risiko for den jevne investor. 

Forskningen som la til grunn for opprettelsen av Huddlestock Capital AS har vist at den preliminære teknologien k an gi svært lovende resultater i forhold til tradisjonelle verktøy for analyse og handel. På Oslo Børs har dette vist seg i en langt høyere avkastning ved å bruke et kvantitativt automatisert analyseverktøy som har samlet historiske data på 10 av de mest  volatile aksjene 4,5 år tilbake i tid. De historiske dataene brukes strategisk for å determinere bevegelser frem i tid, assistert av teknisk- og semantisk analyse.

However, there is a lack of practical IPM tools for farmers with verified effects and usefulness, as well as a relevant policy for a successful implementation of IPM. In SMARTCROP we aim to meet these challenges by: 1) Develop new IPM tools. 2) Test and demonstrate ""best practice"" IPM and study its effect on pests and natural enemies, yield, profitability and environmental risk of pesticides under northern conditions. 3) Develop new simulation models for pest-natural enemy interactions for a near future implementation of natural enemies into pest warning systems. 4) Refine existing pest warning models and pesticide risk models and apply them in web-based warning or decision support systems (DSS) for northern conditions. 5) Suggest innovative policies for increased adoption of IPM. Two annual (spring barley and winter wheat) and two perennial (apple and strawberry) crops, representing a wide range of growing techniques, financial risk profiles and opportunities for IPM technology will be studied. Fields for research and demonstration will be established. Detailed investigations on interactions between key organisms will take place in laboratories and growth chambers. Several project partners and a reference group represent stakeholders and key end-users, including farmers, agricultural extension service, IPM tool companies, regulatory authorities, wholesalers and retailers. These will actively participate in the project, providing the scientists feedback on the feasibility of approaches and techniques under development. This will facilitate robust IPM innovations and ensure adoption of advanced IPM strategies.

244570,Real-time Reservoir Monitoring Integrated with Stress Field Modelling to Allow for Early Detection of Deformations and Leakages,2015,2018,"To reduce the environmental impact from the Norwegian petroleum operations, produced waters are often re-injected in dedicated shallow aquifers or re-used for EOR purposes. Such injection processes and general pressure management pose risks of leakage or even cap-rock failure. Misinterpreted pressure management may result in rapid deformation, often manifested as micro-earthquakes or even larger magnitude earthquakes.

The three main knowledge needs targeted in this proposal are:
1)we need to know how to characterize microseismic events such that we can quickly discriminate events to belong to class-I (pressure induced events) or class-II (stress triggered events)  type of events
2)we need to understand through geomechanical modelling under which circumstances we can expect class-I and class-II type of events
3)we need to increase the competence in integrating real-time microseismic monitoring with geomechanical modelling such that there is a feedback loop between monitored deformation and stress field modelling. 
Solving these knowledge gaps, we will get closer towards workflows for early warning systems towards leakage detection and pressure management in particular during re-injection of produced water.
The proposed project consists of three scientific work packages that will be based on the analysis of high-resolution industry datasets. The main dataset will be provided by Statoil and will consist of passive seismic data from an ocean-bottom cable system offshore Norway (likely Snorre or Grane fields). From the same field we will receive all relevant geomechanical model information. The secondary dataset will also be provided by Statoil and will consist of passive seismic data from onshore hydraulic fracture stimulation. This dataset will serve as a controlled test experiment for both microseismic analysis and geomechanical stress modelling, before transferring the gained knowledge to the offshore Norway case, where noise conditions pose an additional challenge.",Teknisk-industrielle institutter,Instituttsektor,7192000,Andreas Wuestefeld,STIFTELSEN NORSAR,Lillestrøm

Dette konseptet skal implementeres som en prototyp. I et forprosjekt finansiert av FHF har de grunnleggende prinsippene for å fjerne ett-og-ett pinnebein blitt bevist, og det er estimert at utbyttetapet kan bli mindre enn 1% - noe som er en enorm forbedring i forhold til dagens manuelle V-kutt. En prosesseringslinje basert på teknologien som utvikles i BONELESS vil kunne erstatte både dagens manuelle V-kutt og kunne konkurrere med eksisterende automatiske løsninger basert på vannjet. De to hovedfordelene med innovasjonen er 1) økt utbytte på fileten etter beinfjerning, 2) fleksibilitet i forhold til å kunne produsere beinfrie porsjoner og/eller hel beinfrie filet.
De viktigste innovasjonene i BONELESS er: Modul for real-time deteksjon av ett-og-ett pinnebein, og modul for fjerning av ett-og-ett pinnebein.
BONELESS-innovasjonene vil kunne ha vesentlig betydning for andre fiskeindustrier enn hvitfisknæringen, inklusive pre-rigor beinfjerning i laks og beinfjerning i internasjonalt viktige hvitfiskarter.

Å anbefale riktig innhold til riktig leser blir en viktig konkurransefaktor i fremtidens medielandskap. Anbefalingsteknologi-prosjektet skal utvikle neste generasjons nyhetsanbefalinger, der avansert innholdsanalyse kombineres med ""consumer intelligence"" - innsikt i brukernes adferdsmønster og brukersegmentering ? for å øke presisjonen og tilpasse publikasjonsstrategier til brukernes atferd. 

Anbefalingssystemer for nyhetstjenester har fram til nå vært hemmet av spesielle utfordringer knyttet til ustrukturerte data og ustabile begrepsapparat, tvetydige brukersignaler, nyhetsartiklers korte levetid og ønsket om serendipity (at brukerne også opplever tilfeldig presenterte artikler som anbefalt). Dette prosjektet vil anvende forskningsresultater fra ontologianvendelser og datalingvistikk til å finne presise, semantiske beskrivelser av artikler og brukeres interesseprofiler, og deretter tilpasse storskala anbefalingsstrategier og maskinlæringsrutiner for bedre å forutsi brukeres atferd og gi de beste nyhetsanbefalingene.  

Anbefalingsløsningen tar sikte på å: (1) opprettholde og styrke medienes konkurranseevne, (2) skape økt varelager for digitale annonser (trafikk og tidsbruk) og (3) øke konverteringen ? dvs. gjøre en (gratis)leser om til betalende.

247619,Microproportioning with crushed sand,2015,2021,"Future concrete industry will use crushed (manufactured) aggregate because use of natural sand and gravel is depleting natural aggregate resources. Environmental impact of transport is reduced by production from local bedrock. The properties of crushed aggregate differ from those of natural ones: angular shape/rougher surfaces and high fines content affecting fresh concrete rheology, -stability, - pumpability and also surface aestethics. Advanced production of fines and tailoring of particle properties (size, surface, shape) can reduce the need for expensive chemicals, making concrete production more sustainable and economical. The project will perform scientific research in the fields of particle production and characterisation, rheology and application of fresh concrete and develop a new microproportioning method to make sustainable concrete with crushed aggregate, particularly aplying the fines. Knowledge to transform concrete industry into user of crushed aggregate is done in 6 research areas: 

1. Full-scale aggregate production. 2. Mapping of material parameters. 3.Material models. 4.Upscaling to concrete rheology. 5.Full scale testing. 6.Result dissemination and publishing.

The industrial need for this research is corroborated by Norcem AS with aggregate, cement and concrete value chain, Feiring Bruk, a local producer and Skanska as end user. The research will be carried out in close collaboration with international partners lead by the Norwegian University of Science and Technology: The Technical University of Denmark (DTU), Sintef,  National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and Princeton University, USA.

Responsible innovations for dignified lives at home for persons with mild cognitive impairment or dementia.,2015,2020,"Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) is an increasingly important concept in the development and governance of science and technology. It has been interpreted as an approach to research and innovation that allows all R&D stakeholders at an early stage (A) to obtain relevant knowledge on the consequences of their actions and on the range of options open to them and (B) to effectively evaluate both outcomes and options in terms of societal needs and moral values and (C) to use these considerations as requirements for design and development of new research, products and services. 

The Assisted Living project takes an RRI approach and conducts research within ICT, health science, social science and ethics. The overall aim of the project is to advance RRI in the field of welfare technology. By adapting an RRI framework, the project's main objectives are to: a) map how stakeholders and experts perceive the state-of-the-art of responsible welfare technologies, focusing on assisted living technologies (ALT); b) develop ALT solutions for users with MCI/D, through an RRI approach; c) judge by an integrated HTA approach whether technologies introduced through an RRI process score better than currently implemented technologies; and d) create a wider dialogue on responsible welfare technologies for the future.
  
The project will develop RRI as a learning process and governance approach and perform research on RRI; targeting the needs of the aging population as a global challenge in welfare provision; and developing competence on responsible innovation within welfare technology development and the care professions.

247697,Multimodal Elderly Care Systems (MECS),2015,2021,"The number of elderly people living at home is increasing and this trend is expected to continue. The challenge then would be how to provide technology that can handle the complex and different environments found in homes. Further, technology can easily be seen as a threat to privacy and lack of interpersonal contact. This proposal addresses these issues by user centered design of systems and the development of adaptive technology. We will further in this project demonstrate the benefits regarding both performance and privacy being improved by applying sensors like cameras on a robot companion rather than having them permanently mounted in a home. These would be used for detecting falls and other non-normal situations. Using new sensor technology, we would also like to explore if it is possible to remotely monitor medical states like pulse, breathing etc. Rather than having elderly themselves activating their personal security alarm in the case of an emergency situation, a target of this project is to make this automatic and not dependent on the person carrying an alarm device. Many systems for elderly have been designed but few have been applied. We think a key reason for this is limited user involvement and few iterations of user testing. Therefore, we will focus specifically on developing our systems with a large degree of user participation.

In conclusion, we will in this project like to implement and evaluate robotic elderly care systems with multimodal sensors that are able to sense, learn and predict future events. That is, by using complementary sensor technology and machine learning analysis and modeling techniques, we will target the development of novel monitoring systems to be applied in home care applications.

The NBRIX project will develop the tools needed by Norwegian industry in order to realize robust, reliable, and cost-effective microdevices with unsurpassed stability or new functionality. 
NBRIX enables microdevices with large actuation movements and unambiguos position control by heterogeneous integration of piezoelectric thin films and piezoresistive silicon microfabrication. Supreme reliability will be achieved through in-depth understanding and mitigation of intrinsic and mechanical fatigue. NBRIX enables fabrication of large-scale liquid treatment systems like water purifiers through the heterogeneous integration of 3D nanostructures and microfabrication, creating large-scale parallel arrays that handle large flows. The same heterogeneous integration enables the incorporation of photonic crystals in microdevices, permitting previously inaccessible wavelengths to be used in microdevice sensing. NBRIX will provide in-depth understanding of the influence of thermo-mechanical stress on component stability. Consideration of material properties, device design, encapsulation, substrate mounting, and the interaction between these allows effective alleviation strategies, thereby high-precision pressure sensors and microdevices with unsurpassed short- and long-term stability can be made. 

NBRIX will result in a process technology platform, applicable in a broad range of applications and device types. This platform will open new market opportunities by four mechanisms: new functionalities, improved device stability, improved device reliability, and cost-effectiveness.

However in the constantly growing patient database of the clinics there is a huge potential for the re-use of data for research and development of a real-time CDSS based on cognitive computing that can be used to find new patterns that might be important for giving the right diagnosis and to predict treatment responses.

We aim at developing an intelligent and electronic real-time CDSS based on dynamic algorithms that are developing along with the constantly growing patient database.  The underlying dynamic algorithms of the CDSS will enable the detection of new important patterns associated with certain treatments and thus be used to forsee a probable outcome for a patient.  Because the algorithms will be dynamic and shaped according to the growing data matrix, the CDSS will be ?trained? to give more and more precise predictions as the database is getting bigger.  The ""training"" of the intelligent CDSS system requires both human training process, involving intensive cooperation between clinicians, statiticians, informaticians and software architects and in the next phases, machine learning; which will be based on automated re-calculation of algorithms.

The working process for real-time CDSS ranges from product development of new features using established technology to Information technology (IT)-innovation, using new technologies to solve new problems. A strong innovation perspective of this research work will be to enlarge the spectrum of possible applications to other fields than nutrition, including situations where patterns change rapidly such as for instance, in rapidly-evolving epidemics.

Dette er unikt i verdenssammenheng, da det blant eksisterende kameraer på markedet i dag alltid er et kompromiss mellom en eller flere av egenskapene; nøyaktighet, oppløsning, hastighet, farge, synsfelt og pris. Frem til nå har dette vært «enten-eller» valg. Dette akter vi imidlertid å endre med ShapeCrafter 3D - verdens første sanntids 3D kamera med submillimeter-nøyaktighet. Spesifikasjonene til vårt produkt åpner for helt nye muligheter, f.eks. innen maskinsyn og robotikk (M&R) eller ifm. 3D printing.

M&R-markedet forventes å være på $9.5 mrd. USD i 2020 med 12.5% CAGR (Markets and Markets). Markedskravene går mot raskere avbildning av større synsfelt med høyere oppløsning, høyere nøyaktighet og full farge. Vi har grunn til å tro at kundene er betallingsvillige og at det er utsikter til relativt store volum (>10.000) selv med moderat markedspenetrasjon. Vi tror derfor at M&R er et godt introduksjonsmarked for ShapeCrafter 3D, da det her later til å finnes betalingsvillige kunder som aksepterer ny teknologi og utsikter til relativt store volum (>10.000) selv med moderat markedspenetrasjon.

Viktige aspekter i FORNY-prosjektet blir (1) å gjøre en grundig gjennomgang av mulige markeder og markedsvertikaler (både maskinsyn/robotikk, 3D scanning/printing m.m.), bestemme hva skal vi prioritere og om vi skal gå ut bredt eller spisset, (2) verifisere at et industrielt kamera er realiserbart og kan bli konkurransedyktig på pris/ytelse i forhold til state-of-the art med lavere ytelse og prosesseringskrav (3) Avklare den riktige forretningsmodellen, studere forholdet mellom sluttbrukere, distributører, software-aktører, system-integratører m.m. og finne vår plass i verdikjeden.

249261,Environmental Contours for SAfe DEsign of Ships and other marine structures,2016,2019,"The ECSADES project will address important and pertinent issues related to the safe design and operation of ships and other marine structures. Such structures need to be designed according to tolerable risk levels. However, in order to understand the risks, the understanding of the extreme ocean environments and their interaction with fixed and floating structures is critical. In this regard, design contours are useful in describing the joint behavior of various environmental parameters, structural loading and response variables. 

Currently, there are different approaches to establishing environmental contours, and they all have certain strengths and weaknesses and different mathematical and statistical properties. One main objective in this project is to further develop one of the novel approaches to estimating environmental contours with clearly understood probabilistic properties. Moreover, a detailed comparison study involving climate descriptions from different important ocean regions and various structural problems will be performed in order to better understand the effect of the estimation method on the resulting design and reliability levels. Furthermore, some interesting and challenging special cases will be investigated, and methods for contour estimation in non-trivial cases will be explored. These spacial cases include the multidimensional case, non-stationary case with the effect of covariates and the case of bimodal environmental distributions. 

It is anticipated that the results from this project will be directly relevant to the design of ships and other marine structures, and that the results will be incorporated in standards, recommended practices and guidelines from DNV-GL. Furthermore, project results will be implemented in the Riscue software.",Næringsliv,Næringsliv,3555291,Erik Vanem,DNV AS,Bærum

NorTex is built on the existing initiatives already carried out by the Norwegian Consulate General in Houston, Innovation Norway, INTSOK, and the Norwegian-American Chamber of Commerce in Houston. 
The main area of focus for the proposed NorTex Data Science Cluster is to initiate and expand collaboration on education and research within Big Data and data analytics between universities and industry in Norway and Texas, and further to integrate relevant industry into the different university collaborations. The prioritized area of application for the proposed project will be within Energy, but areas such as Health, Urban Development and Education are equally important and will be a part of the NorTex Data Science Cluster in the longer term. 
In today's drilling and well operations, data is collected from numerous sources with different data format and with limited data validation, typically unstructured and not adequate for real-time data processing. When drilling a well, data from down hole is restricted by the poor bandwidth from mud pulse telemetry, but will be largely increased by high-speed telemetry. When large amount of down-hole measurements can be transmitted, processed and analyzed in real time, the ability to prevent drilling anomalies and optimize drilling performance will be revolutionized.
The objectives of this project addresses Big Data and data processing challenges that need to be addressed in order to close the Technology Gaps defined by OG21.

250128,"COmputing BRAin signals (COBRA): 
Biophysical computations of electrical and magnetic brain signals",2016,2020,"Most of what we know about the dynamics of the brain has been learned from measurements of electrical brain signals such as local field potentials (LFP), i.e., electrical potentials recordings inside the brain,,  electroencephalography (EEG), i.e., recordings of electrical potentials at the scalp, electrocorticography (ECoG), i.e., potentials recorded on the cortical surface, and magnetoencephalography (MEG), i.e., recordings of magnetic fields outside the head. Despite their long history and widespread use, the proper interpretation of these brain signals in terms of the biophysical activity in underlying neurons (nerve cells) and neuronal networks is still lacking. Present-day analysis is predominantly statistical and limited to identification of phenomenological signal generators without a clear biophysical interpretation. New biophysics-based analysis methods are thus needed to take full advantage of these brain-imaging techniques.   

The primary goal of the transdisciplinary project COBRA is to address this challenge by developing physics-based computational schemes, based on biologically detailed neuron models and validated against in-house experiments, for calculating the contributions from populations of cortical neurons to electric (LFP, EEG, ECoG) and magnetic (MEG) brain signals, i.e., do 'virtual brain measurements'. This COBRA scheme will then in collaboration with various collaborators, including prominent international projects such as EUs Human Brain Project and Project MindScope at the Allen Brain Institute, be  
(i) used to explore how the various brain signals depend on the properties and state of the cortical networks of the cortical neurons, 
(ii) compared with various types of experimental data from mice and humans,    
(iii) developed into a Python software package (LFPy) for use in large-scale brain-network simuations and analysis tools.",Universiteter,UoH-sektor,8997000,Gaute T. Einevoll,Fysisk institutt,Oslo

The application requirements are determined by the medical experts that will also perform user studies. An extensible data acquisition system will be implemented with smart phones and sensors, like Shimmer motes and the Bitalino sensor set. This system will be used to collect longitudinal data from sleep monitoring at home and in the sleep laboratory (combined with classical polysomnography to annotate the ground truth).
Supervised learning (data mining) techniques will be systematically studied for their use to automatically analyze longitudinal data for OSA detection. These studies will use data from the PhysioNet databases (early project phase), and later-on data that has been collected in user studies with the data acquisition system. Furthermore, we investigate the usefulness of supervised and unsupervised learning (data mining) techniques to identify interesting data patterns that might lead to new knowledge in OSA research and to support the design and engineering of the on-line analysis tool. The design of the on-line analysis tool is driven by the goal to enable individuals with limited computing skill to customize and personalize the on-line analysis. To achieve this goal, the following three principles will be strictly applied: use of a declarative approach with Complex Event Processing, using few powerful abstractions of physical and logical sensors, and a fine granular modularization implemented in sensor hierarchies. Furthermore, the team will build tools to quantify the quality of off-line and on-line data analysis results.",Universiteter,UoH-sektor,8955000,Vera Goebel,Institutt for informatikk,Oslo
250357,Quantum Machine Learning,2016,2020,"Machine learning on graphs induces correlations between unconnected nodes. How can non-local quantum resources enhance performance? We shall develop strategies for distributed measurement and (neural) message-passing for quantum machine learning, based on quantum random walks on graphs, where `creative' learning scenarios are developed and assessed. Shannon capacity is a graph-theoretic method to assess the ability of a channel to transmit messages. It is a celebrated problem to determine the Shannon capacity of a graph - the Shannon capacity of the simple 7-cycle remains open for 56 years now, reflecting the importance of the problem. Recent results identify that the Lovasz number, an upper bound on Shannon capacity, evaluates the quantum advantage of performing quantum measurements on a system as opposed to classical measurements and is central to the notion of quantum contextuality. Our project proposes to investigate generalisations of Shannon capacity and Lovasz - the edge of a graph usually connects mutually exclusive propositions, and we generalise so that connected propositions are exclusive to within some probability. We also associate to each edge a probabilistic message allowing  us to consider generalised Shannon capacities and Lovasz numbers of graph and hypergraph-based message-passing algorithms. A further generalisation is to replace with generalised measurement strategies based on, say, tight frames or other non-orthogonal sequence sets. Moreover we shall classify graphs according to generalisations and variations of their Shannon capacity, Lovasz number, and fractional packing number. We plan to consider message-passing algorithms on non-bipartite, mixed, and dynamic graph and hypergraph scenarios, both in classical and quantum contexts.

250503,Autonomy and manipulation: Enhancing consent in the health care context,2016,2022,"Informed consent, which is a shorthand for informed, voluntary, and decisionally-capacitated consent, is required across a wide swath of human activities, including employment, medical care, medical research, professional relationships, and so forth. Underlying this requirement is the value placed in liberal societies on allowing for the pursuit of rival conceptions of the good life, thereby respecting the autonomy of individuals to make decisions in matters that concern their own welfare. This project aims to develop a theory of what constitutes undue influence on such decisions - in particular influence exerted through various forms of manipulation - that makes explicit its connections with non-autonomous decision-making. Second, it will attempt to determine what role, if any, ""nudges"" and other interventions can legitimately play in enhancing decision-making in the health care context. In particular, it focuses on two cases which have been little explored in the literature. First, the use of empowerment strategies in nurse-patient relationships to enhance patients' capacity to make informed decisions. Second, the use of ""nudges"" to guide or manipulate the health-related life-style choices of socially disadvantaged individuals. It is argued that both cases raise important ethical challenges. Through conceptual analysis of key terms, such as ""empowerment"" and ""autonomy"", as well as thorough investigation into the impact of social and cultural constraints on the autonomy of individuals' health-related life-style choices, the project will suggest how best to deal with these challenges. To make the analysis practically relevant, the general findings will be condensed into clarified policy recommendations.",Universiteter,UoH-sektor,8541000,Edmund Henden,Senter for profesjonsstudier,Oslo
250661,Unravelling the spatio-temporal nature of rock deformation using 4D X-ray tomography,2016,2020,"When rocks deform in the interior of the Earth and along plate boundaries, they release part of the internal energy of the planet. These deformations may be either brittle, for example during earthquakes, or ductile, for example in shear zones or during slow earthquakes. The search for precursors to brittle deformations and for the parameters that control the transition towards ductile processes in the presence of reactive fluids represents key challenges to be investigated in this project. A major difficulty in understanding many geodynamic processes is that they occur at depths where data and samples cannot be accessed directly. However, in specially designed laboratory experiments, it is now possible to reproduce the conditions and thus geodynamic processes occurring between 0 and 10 km depths. 
A triaxial rock deformation rig, the only one of its kind worldwide because it is see-through at such thermodynamic conditions, has been developed at the Univ. of Oslo, in collaboration with the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF). Samples under pressure and temperature will be imaged in-situ using synchrotron X-ray tomography directly inside the rig at a spatial resolution down to 0.6 micrometer under a photon energy of 60 keV. This device is installed on the beamline ID19 at the ESRF, the only beamline in Europe where the necessary energy and spatial resolution can be reached. With this new apparatus, a major advance is expected in rock physics, and more generally in material sciences, with several international academic research groups engaged.
We will use the 3D data acquired at different spatial resolution at the ESRF to search for aseismic precursors to rupture and simulate mechano-chemical processes where fluid flow and chemical reactions are coupled to deformation. These studies will be fundamental to search for the evolution of fluid transport properties in the Earth's crust and applications in the domain of geo-engineering will be also developed.",Universiteter,UoH-sektor,9089000,Francois Renard,Institutt for geofag,Oslo
250679,MEMBRANE: ModEling Mobile BRoAdband NEtworks,2016,2020,"Mobile broadband (MBB) networks underpin numerous vital operations of the society and are arguably becoming the most important piece of the communications infrastructure. The use of MBB networks has exploded over the last few years due to the popularity of mobile devices, combined with the availability of high-capacity 3G/4G mobile networks. More than half of this mobile traffic is generated by mobile video. Given the increasing importance of MBB networks, there is a strong need for a better understanding of the fundamental characteristics of MBB networks and their relationship with the performance of popular applications, such as mobile video.
The overarching goal of the MEMBRANE project is to address this need by developing reliable models that can accurately capture the relationship between the performance and reliability parameters and the underlying network factors that affect them. These models will thus reveal the key factors that are required to accurately describe and predict the performance and reliability of MBB networks in general and mobile video in particular. 
To achieve this goal, we will follow a real-world measurement-driven modeling approach. As the first step, we will first run an extensive measurement campaign to collect data from operational MBB networks in order to understand their performance and reliability. Second, we will derive machine-learning based models using the collected data in order to capture the network characteristics of MBB networks. Finally, we will extend our models to consider the performance of mobile video, more specifically video streaming, experienced by the end users. 
These models will be instrumental for different stakeholders from operators to application developers in improving the quality of their services and products. Therefore, MEMBRANE will have a significant impact on different sectors of industry while helping to improve the performance of their products leading to a better user experience for the end users.",Øvrige forskningsinstitutter,Instituttsektor,6972000,Özgü Alay,SIMULA RESEARCH LABORATORY AS,Bærum
250910,Wireless Social Devices Enabled by Self-Organized Spectrum Cartography,2016,2022,"WISECART proposes a drastically new concept for the design of future wireless heterogeneous networks, including both mobile terminals and different types of devices in the context of Wireless Sensor Networks and the emerging paradigms of Internet-of-Things and Cyber-physical Systems, in order to meet the extremely demanding future societal needs. The main idea is to provide wireless heterogeneous networks and devices with the autonomous capability to form highly adaptive collectively social intelligent local mesh-type formations, by means also of novel machine learning algorithms. The operational parameters of the network (from physical to network layer) are adjusted according to their interaction with the environment, energy availability and, most importantly, on the communication needs established by either a user or a collection of socially engaged users and devices. The new concept of Club, along with Spectrum Cartography, makes this research ground-breaking. This requires wireless devices and networks to have the following challenging features (not currently present today): a) endowment with some native social intelligence across all the communication layers, not only at the application layer as in current solutions, b) full capability to coordinate locally, in a self-organized manner, the space-time-frequency radio resources, providing high flexibility,robustness and reactivity to dynamic rapid changes in local radio activity and heterogeneous traffic demands; c) much higher degree of decentralization for coordination mechanisms in these networks, which in turn requires also a joint energy-aware optimization of the distributed sensing, computation and communication tasks across the nodes, instead of treating them as separate optimization problems, as in previous work. Experimental evaluation will be performed through both simulations and by constructing a wireless network demonstrator composed of heterogeneous terminals with sensing, cognitive and reactive capabilities.",Universiteter,UoH-sektor,11909000,Baltasar Beferull-Lozano,Institutt for IKT,Kristiansand
251327,Change detection in heterogeneous remote sensing images,2016,2019,"This project will employ a PhD student who shall develop a suite of algorithms capable of detecting changes in both pairs and longer time series of co-located remote sensing images captured by different sensors or with different acquisition modes. Traditional algorithms for change detection in images typically assume that the images are perfectly co-registered and co-calibrated, such that no change corresponds to zero difference or unit ratio between the compared pixels. This assumption is in most practical applications unrealistic due to variations in viewing geometry and environmental conditions, phenological evolution of vegetation, and other factors that cannot be perfectly compensated for. We proposed an alternative strategy: A pattern of typical temporal evolution is established by use of distance measures that quantify the statistical similarity of sensor measurements. These can be used to contrast single pixels or groups of pixels along both the spatial and the temporal dimension. Clusters of pixels that behave similarly in terms of temporal evolution define a thematic ground cover class with no change. Changes will be detected as divergence and bifurcation within such a cluster, as the spatial configurations or temporal profiles will deviate from the main pattern when changes occur. The distance-based approach will be implemented with kernel methods from recent award winning work on machine learning. The design will rely on a judicious combination of: (i) parametric models that capture prior knowledge based on a physical understanding of the sensors, with (ii) nonparametric models that allow the required flexibility to combine heterogeneous sources of information and to model the sampling distributions of the test statistics. The PhD student will be trained in collaboration with the University of Genoa, Italy, allowing research visits to and co-tutoring by leading experts and authors of seminal work on the topic.",Universiteter,UoH-sektor,3200000,Stian Normann Anfinsen,FAKULTET FOR NATURVITENSKAP OG TEKNOLOGI,Tromsø

On one hand, they are small, flexible and have low overhead costs compared to bigger enterprises. On the other hand, they are dependent on manual work force which makes their competitiveness dependent on the wage level ? which is significantly higher in Western Europe and USA compared to Eastern Europe and Asia. 

There is some special challenges for SMEs to invest into robot systems. Firstly, the have small series production, requiring rapid reconfiguration. Secondly, they have often lack of expertise on robotics and automation.

251369,"Solar Atmospheric Modelling, adjunct professor position",2016,2019,"Solar magnetism lies at the root of most solar and heliospheric physics. The intricate structure of the solar field, the activity cycle and the influence of the field on the heliosphere represent major quests of (astro) physics which bear directly on the human environment. The sun's magnetic field is generated by enigmatic dynamo processes in the solar interior, is organized into the highly complex patterns of solar activity observed in the solar photosphere, dominates the structure of the outer solar atmosphere (chromosphere, transition region, corona), regulates the solar wind, and affects the whole extended heliosphere into the Earth's upper atmosphere.

A wealth of observational data is now available through the highly successful SOHO satellite, the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope (SST), the Japanese Hinode satellite, the Solar Dynamics Observatory and the Interface Region Imaging Spectrotraph (IRIS). More data will arrive through the projects under development such as Solar Orbiter, the Daniel K Inoue Solar Telescope (DKIST, previously ATST) and the European Solar Telescope (EST). The overwhelming complexity of these new high resolution observations underscores the need for a comensurate effort into theoretical modelling.  The project ``Solar Atmospheric Modelling'' aims at being such an effort.

Through the first years of SAM we have developed an expertise that is much sought after internationally. We have developed the necessary tools and codes to treat 3D radiation-magneto-hydrodynamics problems with a realistic treatment of the radiation. We participate in various NASA programs.

251396,Statistical methods for high dimensional sensor based monitoring of ship systems,2015,2019,"Maintenance and inspections of ships performed by DNV GL have traditionally been based on a preventive scheme where components have been overhauled or maintained according to a time schedule. This philosophy is based on the assumption that a component has a defined lifetime, after which its failure rate increases. However, estimates of lifetime have large uncertainties and a large percentage of failures are not age-related, and are therefore not adequately addressed by preventive scheduled maintenance. DNV GL aim to develop radically new statistical approaches based on the recent availability of large arrays of sensors, which monitor condition and behaviour of machinery and power systems.

Data are ubiquitous: almost every activity in which DNV GL engages produces and requires data. More and more ships get sensors installed, collecting more and more data. Data are the critical inputs into almost all decisions. Statistical inference is needed to turn data into knowledge, to understand unexplained mechanisms, discover hidden patterns, and predict future behaviours. As the accessibility, volume and complexity of data increases, new model based statistical and machine learning methods must be developed.

Sensor data from ship generate very high dimensional time series, which relate to each other either in a known way (network of sensors) or in terms of stochastic dependence (correlation, coherence). These will be analysed for motif discovery, anomaly detection and classification. The purpose is to automatically alert about shifts in trends, variability or extremes, about changing patterns of behaviour or about any potential deviations from the norm. We will in particular consider state space models and other Bayesian hierarchical models. Both classification of faults, prediction of condition and faults, and optimization of performance are possible key aspects of this PhD.",Næringsliv,Næringsliv,1565000,Erik Vanem,DNV AS,Bærum
251579,Decision Support System for Patient-Driven Monitoring Of Cognitive Decline through Computer Aided Personal Support for Cognitive Resources,2015,2017,"PROBLEM: The economic burden of cognitive decline is staggering. Beyond the immense financial and social cost associated with dementia, healthy cognitive decline exacts a massive toll on quality of life, productivity and healthcare services for the European Union. Individual patients are currently unable to track their cognitive decline or self manage the best approaches during the decline.
SOLUTION: This project, the Computer Aided Personal Support for Cognitive Resources (CAPS-CORE), will develop a Decision Support System (DSS) for mitigating the effects of cognitive decline on individuals, and, at a national level, provide a vehicle for advancing early detection of dementias and improving health economics. 
PROJECT OUTPUTS: The principal output of this project will be a computer modelling-based monitoring and self-management system that will evaluate an individual's cognitive state in the moment using advanced bio-behavioral analysis of speech and response time with user feedback. Additional outputs include models for estimating the health economic impact for the DSS system.
IMPACTS: The DSS will help maximize cognitive functioning and resilience by encouraging individually-tailored lifestyle plans. It will improve the participation of patients in the care process, improving management of the disease and reducing the number of severe episodes and complications. This will reduce the economic burden on individuals and on EU healthcare services. 
THE CONSORTIUM TO ACHIEVE THE IMPACTS: The CAPS-CORE consortium is a five-country multinational effort with world-leading expertise in clinical neuropsychology, cognitive neuroscience, healthcare informatics, machine learning, health economics, software development, and commercial exploitation. During this four-year project, we will develop the CAPS-CORE platform, validate it with both healthy and clinical populations and their family and medical support teams, and release a commercially viable product for public use.",Universiteter,UoH-sektor,74900,Brita Elvevåg,Institutt for klinisk medisin,Tromsø

Etter en dramatisk bussulykke på Dovre i 2011, der sterk vind i kombinasjon med dårlig friksjon var sterkt medvirkende til ulykken, ble noen overganger utstyrt med friksjonsmålere. For å videre utvikle varslingen på fjelloverganger er noen også blitt utstyrt med siktmålere.
De ovennevnte sensorer er hver for seg gode til å si hvordan situasjonen er der de står og i et begrenset område rundt. For å kunne dekke hele fjellovergangen og generalisere til flere fjelloverganger, er det påkrevd med et mer finmasket sensornett. Dette prosjektet ser for seg å benytte et allerede pågående forskningsprosjekt. Statens vegvesen, NTNU og Sintef er allerede involvert i et prosjekt sammen med Vovlo technologies hvor man henter friksjonsforhold fra bilen (V2X). Prosjektet har navnet Road Status Information (RSI). I RSI etableres en demonstrasjon hvor man benytter 500 biler i Norge. I tillegg vil biler fra 2016 modellen og utover ha denne teknologien som standard. Med en flåte med biler som kontinuerlig måler friksjon, vil man kunne dekke hele fjelloverganger på en bedre måte.
Med et så godt utbygd sensornettverk er tanken at man skal kunne benytte sensor-data sammen med tidligere erfaringer for å forutsi hvordan forholdene vil utvikle seg fram i tid, samt gi råd om mulige tiltak basert på virkningsgraden av tidligere tiltak.
CBR er basert på en psykologisk teori om at mennesket lagrer kunnskap i situasjonsbestemte observasjoner, såkalte cases, og at man resonerer basert på generalisering av disse tidligere observasjonene. 
På grunnlag av dette vil et CBR-system kunne bygges, og fortløpende overvåke situasjonen på de mest utsatte strekningene på E6 Dovrefjell.
En slik prediksjon vil kunne ha flere effekter. Både med tanke på trafikksikkerhet, fremkommelighet og forutsigbarhet samt et mer effektivt vintervedlikehold av veier.

This system represents an improvement compared to existing monitoring systems (Wind Chill Index, WCI) used by petroleum industry today. The WCI only takes into account the risk of frostbite. By including a system for detecting risk at an earlier stage (e.g. degradation in manual performance) and allowing for monitoring at an individual level, workers and foremen will have a system for improved decision support. This is expected to lead to longer continuous outdoor working time and safe industrial process without process shutdowns. In addition to petroleum workers, it is expected that the system will be of value within a range of other industries, such as the fisheries, aquaculture, forestry, farming, security surveillance and military.

The WP2 is expected to develop smart solutions for hand protection using new design, sensor and software technology and wearable auxiliary heating devices. The workers are expected to be able to do their all tasks without taking off the gloves while working in cold climate. The solutions would be usable in most type of industries requiring good manual performance in cold.

I tillegg har en i bløtt vev skjærbølger, også kalt deformasjons bølger, som ikke skaper volum kompresjon. Disse har lav bølgehastighet ~  1 - 10 m/s som varierer sterkt med struktur av store molekyler i vevet. Skjærbølgehastigheten er derfor nyttig til å differensiere mellom ulike typer vev, spesielt evaluere vevstyper som angitt i hovedmålet.

Ved SURF imaging undertrykkes multiple støy i bildet sterkt, og en er i stand til å skille mellom lineær og ulineær spredning. I tillegg estimerer man en ulineær elastisitets parameter som kan benyttes til å skille vevstyper, hvor  for muskelvev og for animalsk fett.

Redusert støy i bildene forbedrer også bestemmelsen av skjærbølge-stivhet i vevet, slik at man har mulighet for å trekke ut to kvantitative parametre som avhenger av detaljer i vevsstrukturen.

Ut fra forskningen ved ISB er det med hjelp fra NTNU-TTO etablert et nytt firma, SURF Technology AS. Firmae har hatt støtte fra NFR-FORNY2020 for å utvikle et demonstrator instrument for SURF imaging. Man planlegger å bygge flere instrumenter utover i 2016. Det gjenstår flere interessante utfordringer innen signalbehandling, spesielt kvanttativ estimering av samt skjærbølge stivhet. Det kan også være behov for nye design av to-frekvensprober for de spesielle anvendelsene for dyr og fisk.

254913,"Reducing risk in aquaculture - improving operational efficiency, safety and sustainability",2016,2020,"This project will research and develop novel concepts for autonomous operations and technology to improve safety and efficiency in aquaculture. In particular, the project will address daily operations and inspection, maintenance, and repair (IMR) for exposed locations, but the project results will also be applicable to more sheltered fish production. Moreover, the project will assess, utilize and possibly adapt technology developed for subsea IMR in the oil and gas industry. Advances in sensor technology, robotics, ICT, and localization methods create new opportunities for reducing operators' manual workload and exposure time on the facilities at sea, for preventing fish escape, and for improving safety and operational efficiency. 

Current technologies and operations in fish farms are highly dependent on manual labor, which leads to close human interactions with tools and fish cage structures. The sea-based aquaculture industry is one of the most dangerous occupations in Norway, and fish farms operate at the edge of safety limits. Moving fish farms into more exposed areas will lead to increased challenges related to the working environment and management of operations. Hence, technological innovation and autonomy are important for future industry expansion. To ensure that the new concepts reduce risk to people and the environment, adequate risk management becomes even more important for sustainable fish farming operations in the future. 

In short, the research challenges related to this proposal are:
-To research and develop a novel integrated risk management framework for aquaculture, which links occupational and major hazard risk closer to environmental performance, focusing on the opportunities for autonomy in technologies and operations.
-To research and develop innovative autonomous technology for aquaculture operations related to the outcomes of the risk management framework. 
-To test/verify concepts in relevant NTNU/industry facilities.",Universiteter,UoH-sektor,6706000,Ingrid Bouwer Utne,Institutt for marin teknikk,Trondheim
255109,Virtual House Doctor,2015,2016,"Can we provide timely diagnostic judgment for outpatients with chronic neurologic disorders? An envisioned system collects passive and elicited bio-behavioral data and links these data to a patient's cumulative bio-behavioral profile and medical records to detect significant events and help guide the management of the patient's care. Developing such a diagnostic monitor will require ICT advances.  First, automated in-situ collection of data needs to be so simple, unobtrusive and helpful that it is widely accepted by outpatients; while it has to be accurate enough to reliably deliver key information that drives an effective diagnostic process. Second, an automated diagnostic process needs to learn how to combine an individual's continuous incoming data with that individual's medical records so that the process can approach the accuracy of a skilled doctor. These requirements suggest four research challenges (A) Find the most acceptable and reliable ongoing patient information streams; (B) Identify the most specific and useful patient data for early diagnosis and monitoring; (C) Build an accurate diagnostic inference engine that merges ongoing data streams with individual medical histories; and (D) Find user-interfaces that promote patient acceptance and compliance. 
To address these challenges, VHD team will build a research system to collect data, and then develop and evaluate diagnostic algorithms.  The piloting system will track outpatients' location, movement, and activities and analyze them in relation to that person's typical daily patterns.   It will also implement several interaction modalities to elicit verbal and other task behavior to probe for symptoms and measure signs.  The core project focus will be the development of an accurate inference engine that uses deep learning to select among diagnostic responses. If the project has success with neurological conditions, it will expand to other chronic conditions and be made available to other research groups.",Helse Nord RHF,Helseforetak,499000,Brita Elvevåg,UNIVERSITETSSYKEHUSET NORD-NORGE HF,Tromsø

Knowledge based management of the coastal zones depends on wide knowledge of our marine ecosystems, their structure, function and how they respond to combined stress from exploitation of the resources, exposure to pollutants (e.g. waste disposal from mining, industrial and municipal wastewater) and climate change. The primary goal of ENTiCE is to quantify how physical forcing (e.g. tidal mixing and upwelling) controls the nutrient availability and light regime and thereby impacts productivity, community structure and function in a highly productive coastal region along the Norwegian Coast. The secondary goal is to create enabling technology beyond state of the art for cost effective and high quality sampling. These objectives will be achieved by developing, testing and deploying technology and model systems with an inter-disciplinary group of scientists and engineers with a significant outreach component for local high-school students.

At the core of the project is the research and development of a new ICT platform for integration and visualization of multimodal-sourced images and biomedical data. Such a platform is strongly warranted in the area of personalized cancer diagnostics, treatment and follow-up, but related needs permeate the health sector and beyond.  

Research challenges include:

Software reliability, robustness and security of such a platform and related applications. 

Flexible user interface solutions accommodated to empower the users (clinicians) to make qualified diagnostic decisions or treatment choices.

Adaptive capacity of the platform to embed emerging technologies currently not implemented in the clinic.

Meta-modelling and integration of data from varied sources (e.g. magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and spectroscopy (MRS), ultrasound, mass spectrometry imaging (MSI), PET, molecular analyses of targeted biopsies on the genetic, proteomic and metabolic level, and clinical parameters and metadata), with vast differences in category or spatial and temporal resolution.

Actual models, structural and functional, for the cancer challenges we are targeting.

Tools for analysis and exploration of data, using visualization as well as statistics and machine learning on multivariate data.

An especially exciting aspect of such big data analysis is that it enables novel approaches, methods, and tools for personalized medicine. In particular it is possible to use the data to develop innovative clinical tools that predict either a diagnosis or the best treatment for a patient or a patient group (stratum). However, realizing this potential requires developing novel statistical methods and implementing these for efficient processing of big datasets. In this project we will establish collaboration between research groups with expertise in machine learning and computer system development in order to develop prediction methods and tools for a unique large scale epidemiological study.

As the data collected by the Norwegian Woman and Cancer biobank grow in quantity and variety, needs in terms of machine learning techniques and computational efficiency appeared, leading to new interdisciplinary projects.

Since 2008, Norsvin has been using Computed Tomography (CT) as a tool for measuring body composition in breeding pigs (boars). CT is an in vivo technique, which measures the body composition of a live pig. In order to move towards the next level of precision, not only focusing on the whole body composition of fat, muscle and bone, we need to get anatomical data from the animal. Yield of cuts (ham, belly, loin and shoulder) and internal organs size and volume, are important traits with respect to efficiency, health and market value of the animals. We need to build automatic algorithms in order to analyze, process and gather anatomical data in a large scale breeding system. Today, we are not able to accurately cut the animal into its anatomical pieces in a large scale and automated way. To be able to distinguish between the different meat cuts anatomical labeled atlases from CT have to be developed and new samples to these labeled atlases have to be recorded automatically by image registration

The planned innovation is to implement the use of anatomical atlases from CT in a commercial breeding program for pigs. As far as we know, this is the first attempt to use anatomical atlases from CT in a commercial breeding program, and represents an entirely new way of analyzing images and data from CT scans in a livestock breeding environment.

256435,RigSpray - Developing a tool for prediction of loads from marine icing on offshore structures,2016,2021,"A key element of the project will be the development of a marine icing model that is able to estimate ice accumulation on offshore structures using historical metocean data. This will be obtained by refining an existing numerical model to represent heat transfer and spray flux more accurately whilst maintaining an efficient numerical code. This tool shall be able to estimate marine icing loads that enables the user to calculate relevant annual probability of exceedance for loads from marine icing for a given installation and location. 

The rate of ice accretion is determined by the amount of water hitting a surface per time and the heat transfer from the surface, and both must be accurately predicted for marine icing models to give reliable results. Due to a limited number of available sea spray measurements, all existing models are associated with a large uncertainty in the amount of sea spray. The project aims to reduce the uncertainty related to prediction of sea spray production to an acceptable level by performing measurements on a number of installations offshore. The project includes the development of suitable equipment for reliable long-term measurements of sea spray flux, frequency and duration. The results from these measurements will be used as a basis for a sea spray model included in the tool for calculation of marine icing.",Næringsliv,Næringsliv,9000000,Ole-Christian Ekeberg,DNV AS,Bærum

Vi vil utnytte disse kapasitetene slik at autentisering av brukere kan gjøres lokalt i den mobile enheten og mer fleksibelt ved å kombinere flere datakilder. Smarte, mobile enheter er nå i stand til å samle og behandle store mengder data om sine brukere. Disse dataene kan benyttes for å beregne en sannsynlighet for at det faktisk er eieren som til enhver tid er i besittelse av enheten. Dette åpner muligheten for «datadrevet autentisering» (DDA), en tilnærming til autentisering der data og kontinuerlig analyse av disse er sentral. Idéen i prosjektet er å lage en ny metode for autentisering som er drevet av mange typer (sensor)data fra mobile enheter som kontinuerlig vurderer brukerens autentiseringsnivå med minimal brukerinteraksjon. Hvis kontinuiteten blir for dårlig vil en måtte involvere brukeren og «re-autentisere» seg aktivt, men her kan en benytte andre og mer brukervennlige mekanismer enn passord. Målet er å få en brukervennlig og sikker autentiseringsmetode for smarttelefoner.

Autentisering av brukere i så vel privat som offentlig sektor oppfattes av mange som et nødvendig onde. I dag løses problemet fortsatt i utstrakt grad med relativt svake mekanismer som brukernavn og passord ? den samme mekanismen som ble benyttet for 40 år siden. I beste fall kombineres passordet med en «dynamisk faktor», slik som en engangskode i BankID. I dag har en vanlig privatperson et stort antall brukerkontoer på vidt forskjellige tjenester på tvers av sektorer og bransjer.
Felles for alle mekanismer er at de pålegger brukeren en betydelig og uønsket kognitiv last, som øker brukerterskelen for ulike tjenester. Det er derfor et udekket behov for en påloggingsmekanisme som kan tilby et tilstrekkelig sikkerhetsnivå, og samtidig pålegge brukeren minimal - fortrinnsvis ingen - mental belastning.",Næringsliv,Næringsliv,10240792,Christian Bull,TELENOR DIGITAL AS,Bærum
256695,The Intelligent Cardiovascular Ultrasound Scanner,2016,2019,"Cardiac related disease is the number one cause of death in the Western world, including Norway. Echocardiography is the most important imaging tool for the cardiologist to assess cardiac function. An echo examination of the heart is real time, cost effective and can be performed without discomfort to the patient and without harmful radiation. These are great advantages compared to other medical imaging modalities. 

The key performance indicators for an echo lab are diagnostic accuracy and productivity. For the patient a fast and accurate diagnosis is important for receiving the right treatment. For the hospital the productivity of the echolab has direct economic implications, and early accurate diagnosis alleviates the need for involving more expensive imaging modalities.
A typical cardiac ultrasound examination takes 30-40 minutes; while only about half of this time is spent efficiently acquiring diagnostic quality images. The wasted time is spent manually adjusting image acquisition parameters, searching for optimal views and performing manual measurements. 

The vision for this  project is to create an INtelligent Cardiovascular Ultrasound Scanner - INCUS - that is capable of assisting the user to increased productivity and accelerated decision making. This will be achieved by introducing intelligent algorithms in the scanner that can exploit knowledge from expert users and previously acquired data and learn from this. We will build on recent research in machine learning that has led to a set of approaches referred to as Deep Learning. Deep Learning has boosted the performance substantially for many applications like speech recognition and image classification.

MazeMap har utviklet en unik teknologi for å gjenkjenne og tolke plantegninger (dwg - AutoCAD format) og har en svært skalerbar løsning for å kunne levere innendørs kart.

Teknologien gir et svært godt utgangspunkt for å kunne kjenne igjen trapper og heiser, for på den måten presentere en sti som ikke går via trapper for den som er bevegelseshemmet. Med andre ord at vedkommende får en sti som han kan følge fra der han er til dit han skal. På samme måte har MazeMap byggesteinene som gjør det mulig å presentere en sti ved taleopplesning for den som er blind.

For å øke tilgjengeligheten til bygg foreslår derfor MazeMap og Lydia et prosjekt som skal utvikle:
- En løsning for automatisk å hente ut plantegninger (dwg) og informasjon fra ulike FDV-system (Forvaltnings- drifts og vedlikeholdssystem). På den måten vil det være mulig å levere brukervennlige kart som er «alltid er oppdatert» for alle bygg uten manuelt arbeid.
- Hjelpe bevegelseshemmede med å kunne finne frem på egen hånd ved å vise en sti innendørs som er beregnet for rullestoler, dvs ikke via trapper og andre hindringer.
- Hjelpe blinde og svaksynte med en taleopplest navigasjon innendørs.

Disse metodene har begrensinger med hensyn til geometri, kvalitet eller kostnadsdrivende produksjon p.g.a. lange takttider. Ved sprøytrestøping oppnås høyere overflatekvalitet, bedre strukturelle egenskaper og mindre geometriske variasjoner. I tillegg er prosessen velegnet for effektiv automatisert produksjon. Det finnes et stort marked som etterspør store plastkomponenter med gode mekaniske egenskaper og god overflate kvalitet.

The main project is all about researching and developing ICT solutions to supplement or replace methods in pathology to increase productivity and quality and hence treatment of cancer, based on analysis of Big Data produced by digital pathology.
Most prognostic studies suffer from undersampling. To account for heterogeneity most studies would have to increase the workload by a factor of  5-10. With limited resources and strongly limited access to pathologists, this cannot be achieved unless we manage to digitalize and largely automate both the preparation and analysis required to render a diagnosis and identify prognostic biomarkers.   This is what this project is designed to do, and we have put together a group of international leaders in the different fields involved, from robotics and machine learning to digital image analysis and from tumor pathology to cancer surgery and oncology. 
Our ambition is to completely transfer the very complex thinking and decision-making from its current basis in visual observation to a computer basis with objective, reproducible algorithms. The concepts involved are based on image analysis and more specifically: deep learning, texture analysis, and quantification of DNA. We will focus on three major cancer forms, i.e. lung cancer, colorectal cancer and prostate cancer and work with large retrospective clinical materials with known clinical outcomes and the methods will be applied to routine paraffin-imbedded material.

260205,Machine Learning in Credit Risk Modelling,2016,2021,"The logistic regression is useful in calculating rankings of customer creditworthiness. However, there is large literature showing the advantages of machine learning in credit risk. Machine learning offers higher classification accuracy and solutions to deal with common problems faced in the classical credit risk models. In addition, machine learning can improve credit allocation and estimate credit risk relatively more accurate. Hence, the aggregated social welfare is improved. This is achieve in two ways 1)right customers have access to credit and the credit cost is relatively more accurate, and 2) bank's financial obligations are not threaten by customers' lack of payment. 

Hence, Santander Consumer Bank AS wants to learn from the best-in-class research institutes in the country, and to be able to build in-house competence and use this knowledge to improve bank's credit risk management by building machine learning credit risk models. 

Santander considers this project as an essential part of a long-term strategy for building in-house competence and expertise in machine learning for credit risk modelling. This competence is not limited to Mr. Mancisidor, the industrial PhD candidate. Over the duration of the project, and upon completion of the PhD, Santander aims for Mr. Mancisidor to actively transfer his acquired knowledge in this project to his fellow members of the Nordic Risk Models department.",Næringsliv,Næringsliv,1707000,Andrés Díez,SANTANDER CONSUMER BANK AS,Bærum
261645,Collaboration on Intelligent Machines,2017,2021,"Technology is transforming society and the way we work and interact. We are surrounded by technology and computer interfaces that have recently become more intelligent and are able to adapt to our needs and preferences. Thanks to progress in machine learning and artificial intelligence, we see a major transition from ourselves adapting to fixed technology and services to these by themselves adapting to us human users. Thus, technology works more seamlessly in a continuously increasing number of domains. This includes robots that have traditionally only been used for manufacturing but are now arriving at work and at home as service robots. The success of these would be highly dependent on their behavior capabilities that depend on their skills in learning and adaptation. We see a rapid progress in both learning algorithms and robotic systems, and it is challenging for a single research group to both provide an updated set of courses in addition to undertaking state-of-the-research. 

This project would be concerned with international collaboration with leading partners in the US, Brazil and Japan within the domains of such self-learning systems and robotics. It is highly relevant to our two current Research Council of Norway funded researcher projects EPEC and MECS. Thus, it would provide extended momentum to these projects by collaboration in research, teaching, and strengthening the interaction between the two domains. This will be through a set of different activities like short-term and long-term reciprocal mobility stays by students and staff for collaboration in research, curriculum and teaching material development and organizing intensive courses/workshops. The qualifying projects are undertaken by the Robotics and Intelligent Systems (ROBIN) research group at the University of Oslo which is an active research group with regularly about 30 master students, 10 PhD students and three postdocs in addition to the three faculty staff.",Universiteter,UoH-sektor,3495000,Jim Tørresen,Institutt for informatikk,Oslo

More specifically, we will focus on developing applications that will enable geoscientists to apply more quantitative techniques to very large subsurface datasets, thereby facilitating a better understanding of the multidimensional and non-linear relationships existing between some of the key geological properties (e.g. lithology distribution, physical properties). Our project thus has clear benefits for business (e.g. software development, marketing and sales), the exploration and production (E&P) industry (e.g. increased efficiency, and prediction accuracy in exploration for oil and gas) and academia (addressing multiple geoscience disciplines, and not least the integration between them). Furthermore, because integrated, geoscience-driven, ML applications for basin analysis and play evaluation do not yet exist, there is a significant academic challenge embedded in this computer science-based research problem.",Næringsliv,Næringsliv,16000,Eirik Larsen,EARTH SCIENCE ANALYTICS AS,Stavanger
262522,"How to tax capital in a globalized world?
Lessons from population-wide administrative data",2017,2021,"There is growing concern about the practicality of taxing capital in a globalized world. Half of the world's foreign direct investments are routed through offshore tax havens. In April 2016, The Panama Papers showed that rich individuals routinely use shell companies in tax havens to avoid or evade taxes. Still, little is known about who evades capital taxes, why, and to which extent. 

Current estimates on offshore tax evasion are based on aggregate data. We are the first to utilize unique new administrative micro data from Norway and Sweden to provide much sought after insights in the anatomy of capital tax evasion to governments, media, NGOs, and researchers. 

We have access to population wide samples of individuals who have been found evading taxes, data on firms' and individuals' cross-border bank transfers, detailed taxpayer information, exhaustive coverage of the richest individuals at the micro-level, as well as a link between firms and individuals.

First, we provide the first comprehensive assessment of how tax evasion varies across the wealth distribution. By combining our results with aggregate data, we can construct revised estimates of income and wealth inequality all over the world, when taking into account income and wealth that is unreported to tax authorities. 

Second, we develop and implement innovative machine learning methods to detect international tax evasion. If successful, this project could revolutionize the way capital taxes are enforced all over the world.

Third, we provide credible causal estimates of how capital taxation affects international tax evasion. The results are likely to illuminate the public debate on the desirability of wealth taxes, which has gained prominence worldwide following the publication of Thomas Piketty's (2014) book, Capital in the 21st Century. Most importantly, we provide the very first estimate of the tax elasticity of capital flight, which is the key determinant of the optimal tax rate on Capital",Universiteter,UoH-sektor,5616000,Annette Alstadsæter,HANDELSHØYSKOLEN,Ås

The end outcome will be a novel mobile robotic tool for upper water-column microbial biology. In particular, this highly interdisciplinary project will have substantial impact on the study of microbial time-series in ongoing studies of the changing planet. It will accelerate the time consuming process in asking -who is there- from traditional methods of obtaining water samples, storage, transport, microscopy and analysis while leveraging advances in imaging and robotics hitherto not accomplished before.

The proposed project targets fundamental research in the fields of Robotic Vision, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Control Theory. In particular, we propose to couple Robotic Vision based upper water-column sampling and Machine Learning techniques for exploration with a marine robotic vehicle to autonomously target specific microbiological taxa. The AUV will use a novel camera system to image microorganisms in the photic zone (upper 75 meters), process imagery in-situ, categorize and classify based on Deep Learning, generate a probability density map in X,Y and Z planes, and use an advanced AI based controller to return to the most highly correlated hotspots with respect to species of interest. The entire processing chain will be embedded and guided by a human expert (as needed) via a communication link to shore to potentially alter her sampling preferences dynamically making the vehicle to adapt on-the-fly. 

The project funds one doctoral and one post-doctoral fellow and is organized in 4 work packages:

Rhythm is also central to human biology, from the micro-oscillations of our nervous system to our heartbeats, breathing patterns and longer chronobiological cycles (or biorhythms). As such, it is a key aspect of human action and perception that is in complex interplay with the various cultural, biological and mechanical rhythms of the world. 
  The vision behind RITMO is to reveal the basic cognitive mechanism(s) underlying human rhythm, using music, motion and audiovisual media as empirical points of departure. No other interdisciplinary research environment has focused solely on rhythm and its direct and indirect impacts before. Given the fundamental role of rhythm in human life, such an endeavour is long overdue. 
  RITMO will undertake research on rhythm in human action and perception, and on the aesthetic and cultural 'texts' that such processes elicit. This venture will benefit from the combined perspectives of the humanities, cognitive neuroscience, social sciences and informatics. Now is the right time to establish such a centre, because we can finally explore some of the larger questions of the humanities via state-of-the-art technologies for motion capture, neuroimaging, pupillometry and robotics. Such a research strategy is as novel as it is essential to any engagement with the impact of human rhythm. RITMO will generate groundbreaking knowledge about the structuring and understanding of the temporal dimensions of human life. As such, it will change how we view human cognition and supply a cornerstone for the future exploitation of rhythm in applications for well-being and rehabilitation.",Universiteter,UoH-sektor,140700000,Anne Danielsen,Institutt for musikkvitenskap,Oslo
262814,Optimized activation of tumor-associated macrophages as a novel strategy for cancer immunotherapy,2017,2020,"Immunotherapy is considered one of the most promising novel strategies to cure cancer. Enhancement of T-cell mediated antitumor immunity by ""immune checkpoint"" blockade or by T-cell adoptive transfer seems to be particularly promising. However, most patients do not respond to current treatments. By using a mouse model for myeloma, we discovered that tumor-infiltrating macrophages may be very efficient at eradicating cancer upon activation by tumor-specific Th1-polarized T cells. We have recently reported that the Th1-derived cytokine interferon-gamma and the inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1 could synergize to render macrophages cytotoxic to cancerous cells. Thus, it appears that two molecular signals are required for optimal activation of macrophages. In this proposal, we aim at translating our recent findings to novel immunotherapeutic protocols based on 2-signal activation of tumor-infiltrating macrophages. We will use two mouse models for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) including patient-derived tumor xenografts (PDX), which we have already established. Three strategies will be tested for rendering tumor-infiltrating macrophages cytotoxic to cancerous cells: i) in situ macrophage activation with optimized molecular combinations including cytokines and pectic polysaccharides isolated from medicinal plants; ii) intratumoral delivery of immunostimulatory cytokine genes by recombinant alphaviral particles; iii) enhancement of antitumor immunity by immune checkpoint blockade on macrophages. Furthermore, we plan to develop novel prognostic tools for NSCLC based on the analysis of tumor-infiltrating immune cells, and to evaluate PDX as preclinical models for NSCLC immunotherapy. Lung cancer is considered to be potentially quite immunogenic and thereby appropriate for immunotherapy. Therefore, this project may significantly impact the treatment of NSCLC which currently represents a major burden in Norway and worldwide.",Helse Sør-Øst RHF,Helseforetak,10270000,Alexandre Corthay,Avdeling for immunologi og transfusjonsmedisin,Oslo

Mastering mental health issues through smart personalised automatic assistance",2017,2021,"Findings from relevant international and national studies suggests that young people increasingly suffer from mental health issues such as social isolation, anxiety, eating disorders, sexual problems, depression, self-harm and suicidal thoughts. SOCIAL HEALTH BOTS address the increasing need for services that can help young people (16-26 years) with mental health issues.

Internet-delivered health services may be particularly suitable to reach the present digital generation of young people. The recent developments in artificial intelligence and deep learning, coupled with the broad popular uptake of online digital devices and the emergence of huge data sets (big data) make chatbots a promising supplement to more labour-intensive interventions within health and welfare services. However, the automating power of chatbots in the context of health services are largely understudied. SOCIAL HEALTH BOTS will, therefore, increase our understanding of the future potential of this type of technology, and the possible challenges of robotic services in the context of mental health.

Moreover, SOCIAL HEALTH BOTS addresses the need for research and innovation to improve and integrate public healthcare services. This by and understanding of how ground-breaking chatbots can supplement, coordinate and improve relevant health care services targeting young people - to facilitate information and social support for early intervention and a long-term healthy behaviour. 

A human-centred design approach will support a deep understanding of relevant target users (e.g. young people, information providers, health care workers at schools, psychologists and doctors).

Smart spaces, such as smart cities and smart buildings, are proliferating into a massive scale, thereby, IoT data, services and applications are being pressed to move to the Cloud. IoT Cloud integration can enable ubiquitous cyber-physical services and powerful processing of IoT data beyond the capability of individual things. Moreover, this has been recently extended from the core of the network to the edge of the network (i.e., Fog Computing) to address better mobility support, location-awareness and low latency. This has resulted in running IoT application logic on resources throughout the network, including routers and dedicated computing nodes. Therefore, the huge number of IoT services in smart spaces accessible over end IoT nodes, fog nodes and the Cloud, will be used by and shared among a wide range of applications. This will also include cooperation of IoT devices and their ability to become orchestrated into on-demand services accessible in the Cloud. Thus, a crucial need in future smart spaces is scalable and dynamic integration of smart devices into cloud and fog platforms.

The main contribution of this project is to conduct basic research in the area of integration of future large-scale IoT applications into fog and cloud computing platforms. It develops knowledge, software service design concepts and mechanisms for scalable and dynamic integration of huge number of things and their services into future cloud-based IoT systems and the intermediate fog computing platforms. It develops solutions for:

262900,Neodroid - Creating a reality-ready robot brain in virtual reality,2017,2022,"The idea of Neodroid is to create a reality-ready robot brain in virtual reality (VR). We specifically focus on creating a robot brain capable of humanoid visual-motor ability. Visual-motor ability is the integration between visual perception and motor skills. More specifically, it is the ability to perform constructive tasks integrating both visual perception and motor skills. The motivation behind Neodroid is to enable robots to assist humans in performing such tasks.

The primary objective of Neodroid is:
- Develop deep learning architectures for creating a reality-ready robot brain in virtual reality.

The secondary objectives are:
- Implement a virtual reality environment for training a virtual robot.
- Develop deep learning architectures for visual-motor tasks.
- Implement human operation of a robot in virtual reality.
- Demonstrate robot deep learning in virtual reality.
- Demonstrate transfer-learning between virtual reality and the real world.

The essence of Neodroid is a two-stage learning process in VR, followed by introduction to reality. The VR learning stages are first a 'baby' phase with environment-assisted learning, and a 'school' phase where a human enters VR to teach more complex tasks. After the
school phase, the brain is transferred from the virtual to the real robot, so learnt visual-motor skills can be applied in the real world.

The key challenges to enabling near-human level robot visual motor skill, using deep learning, are to generate a large set of training examples and to discover the best deep learning architectures. We believe that these challenges are best met by prototyping deep learning in VR, since this provides greater flexibility and a more cost-efficient and timely data acquisition and teaching process than
using real robots and sensors. Once this architecture is found, it can be transferred to a real robot and refined.",Teknisk-industrielle institutter,Instituttsektor,7970000,John Reidar Mathiassen,SINTEF OCEAN AS,Trondheim

Using this data businesses, governments, and other organizations can provide new and improved services that many now depend on for their daily activities. As emerging technologies for self-monitoring, smart cities, and the Internet-of-Things advance, ever more data and insight on our lives will be captured and stored online.

This mass-scale recording of our digital lives has not come forth without generating strong concerns regarding our privacy. The European Commission has already asserted that we do have the right to control our own data, including the right to be forgotten. The White House has recently also recommended new legislation, granting consumers greater control over their personal information. However, current big-data software stacks and cloud infrastructures does not readily support such rights. The individual, whose life is being recorded, has alarmingly little control and insight in what is being collected and how it is used.

Existing computer systems lack effective means to express and enforce privacy policies on information after it has been shared or stored online. To provide that means, systems must support data policies that change depending on how data are manipulated, apply policies to all copies of data and to any derived data, and enforce policies wherever and whenever the original or derived data are used.

This project will research and develop the concept of privacy automatons, an emerging technology that can capture and enforce complex privacy policies across multiple heterogeneous distributed cloud systems and client devices. To ensure relevancy, an use-case in medical epidemiological cohort studies will drive the research.

In fault situations and for preventive and corrective maintenance of power grid infrastructure, power grid companies have traditionally relied on manual ground based inspections (crews walking the lines) and helicopter based inspections. Recently the use of RPAS (Remote Piloted Aircraft Systems), popularly called drones, has started to be considered by several grid operators as a low cost and low risk alternative to helicopter inspections, and as an additional support to ground crews, greatly reducing the need for them to climb up power pylons with the associated HSE risks.

This industry PhD project aims at investigating the use of the new generation of information technologies based on big data, machine learning, and real-time processing, to support the analysis of data acquired through RPAS based inspections.
One of the main sources of data from RPAS inspections will be still images and video. Other sources of information, such as power-line noise measurements, IR (infra-red) imaging, multispectral and hyperspectral imaging, and LIDAR (light detection and ranging), are being evaluated for their suitability, and might be included later on in the scope of this project.

On one hand, they are small, flexible and have low overhead costs. On the other hand, they are dependent on manual work force which makes their competitiveness dependent on the wage level. Due to this, the SMEs have a high pressure to invest in industrial robot systems to reduce the wage. 
To lower the threshold for SMEs to invest in robot systems, the robots have to be easy to use and be capable to utilize human knowledge during run time. However, this puts high requirements on efficient and intuitive communication between the operator and the industrial robot.
The current robot technology, offers a good solution for large volume production. However, small series productions, requires frequently reconfiguration, and requires a more efficient and intuitive interface for man-machine communication. 
This PhD will develop new technology for man-machine communication which is utilizing multiple human senses in parallel, i.e., vision, audio, haptic etc. By this, the intuitiveness and the efficiency of man-machine communication is intended to be brought to a new level.

267806,Reliable and efficient high-throughput phenotyping to accelerate genetic gains in Norwegian plant breeding (virtual phenomics; vPheno),2017,2022,"New approaches are necessary to meet the goals of increased food production. Plant breeding can play a key role by developing cultivars with higher yield potential. New technologies like genomic selection and high-throughput phenotyping offer possibilities to increase genetic gains through more precise selection and shortening of the breeding cycle. However, considerable research is needed in terms of theoretical developments, statistical modeling and technical solutions to achieve this in practice. By bringing in world-leading expertise in statistical modeling and image analysis, we will develop novel statistical models to extract biologically relevant information from hyperspectral images. The work will consist of developing reliable methods for capturing high-resolution images of field plots, and utilizing novel computational solutions to integrate top view images from drones with close-up images from robots to build 3D models that retain the original resolution and hyperspectral information. Computational algorithms will then be used to extract important physical and physiological traits from these 3D models that can be used directly as selection tools in plant breeding. By coupling hyperspectral data with grain yield and other direct measurements, statistical prediction models will be developed that plant breeders can use in early-generation selection to increase yield gains.

267967,Smart Community Neighborhood - driven by energy informatics,2017,2021,"The current electricity infrastructure lacks mechanisms to handle mass and concentrated energy demands primarily led by Electric Vehicles (EV) charging requirements. A potential mechanism to handle such surges during peak consumption hours without restructuring the grid is through integration of renewable micro energy sources at household or neighborhood levels. It becomes necessary to efficiently harness the potential of prosumers and develop tools to efficiently manage household/neighborhood energy production and consumption. Mechanisms are needed to pool upon the combined micro energy sources, integrate community level power storage units, predict production and consumption and allow sharing/trading of energy between households, neighborhoods and communities.    
ICT based smart-solutions can be used to substantially address and resolve such challenges. Data driven decentralized energy systems can disrupt the existing simplex supply-demand market relationship between producers and customer. With supporting environment-friendly energy production and storage technologies, conventional end customers will be able to produce clean energy locally (e.g. solar energy micro-generation). It would allow them to either meet their own requirements or sell it back to the grid. Meanwhile, the EV batteries could also be added as additional resource to the local energy storage systems. Such resources will be able to store locally generated power and have the capability to spontaneously participate in balancing consumption fluctuations. It will be particularly applicable for fluctuating intensive loads (e.g. heating, charging) and to solve congestion problems.",Universiteter,UoH-sektor,20348500,Chunming Rong,Institutt for matematikk og fysikk,Stavanger
268122,Geosteering for improved oil recovery,2017,2021,"Geosteering decisions are generally based on geological models. To make optimal decisions while drilling, it is necessary that geological models for the near wellbore region are well calibrated against measurements and that the uncertainty is quantified. The current work processes for geosteering suffer from shortcomings. (i) It is highly challenging to calibrate geomodels to deep Electromagnetic Measurements (EM) and Logging While Drilling (LWD) measurements for complex formations. (ii) There is a lack of flexibility in the current geomodels for support of structural updates and fast local updates. (iii) There is a lack of a transparent, systematic and consistent workflow for quantifying complex geological uncertainties in the geomodel, and considering them when making geosteering decisions.  

The primary objective of this project is to develop methodology for geosteering by continuously updating geomodel based on LWD measurements including deep EM measurements. To achieve this objective, we will address the following secondary objectives; 

- Ensemble-based geosteering workflow. Develop and improve an ensemble-based workflow for geosteering that would integrate seamlessly with reservoir management. 

- Processing deep EM measurements. Apply appropriate EM forward modelling tools and investigate efficient processing of EM measurements for integration in geosteeering workflow

- Flexible earth model representation. Further develop a flexible representation of the geological model that supports local updates and uncertainty modelling of the geological structures and properties in real-time.",Teknisk-industrielle institutter,Instituttsektor,15700000,Sergey Alyaev,NORCE Teknologi/Energi VESTLAND,Bergen

268337,"Lucid: a device for early, sensitive and reliable arthritis diagnosis and monitoring",2017,2020,"This project aims to commercialize a novel device for early and precise diagnosis of arthritic diseases in finger joints.  Arthritis is a devastating disease with high prevalence and high personal and societal costs. The burden can be significantly reduced by early and targeted treatment, ideally as soon as the first symptoms occur. However, clinicians lack appropriate diagnostic tools and struggle with early and precise diagnosis.  

Lucid addresses this need as it is a diagnostic device for screening individuals with recent onset of joint pain and for monitoring of treatment in diagnosed patients. Lucid employs hyperspectral imaging (HSI) technology and provides high resolution spectral images from which superior diagnostic information about the diseased joint is derived. The examination is rapid, non-invasive, does not require experienced operator and subjective interpretation of the data. The technology has been jointly developed by NTNU and Norsk Elektro Optikk AS (NEO).
Lucid will be a new diagnostic device for rheumatologists and orthopedic surgeons in hospitals. Therefore, clinical testing and benchmarking will be a major objective of this project. The acquired patient data will be used to optimize and further develop the diagnostic algorithms as well as a decision-making system.

For eksempel hvordan en kan endre ventiler, pumper og trykk for å utnytte flaskehalsene på feltet bedre, og på den måten øke produksjonen.

ProductionCompass krever ikke installasjon av kostbart fysisk utstyr, medfører ingen regulatoriske utfordringer, og representerer ingen risiko for et felts produksjon. Den økte produksjonen vil i de fleste tilfeller ikke medføre økt energiforbruk eller forurensning. Dette betyr bedre utnyttelse av produksjonssystemet, og dermed redusert energiforbruk per produserte fat. Fallet i oljepris representerer et mulighetsvindu for ProductionCompass, siden oljeselskapenes fokus er dreid fra dyre lete- og utbyggingsprosjekter til mindre kostnadskrevende prosjekter knyttet til effektivisering og optimalisering av felt i drift, hvor store investeringer allerede er gjort.

Erfaringer fra det pågående FORNY-prosjektet er at datadrevet produksjonsoptimering ved bruk av ProductionCompass er verifisert på et avgrenset system. Men, for at oljeselskapene skal ta produktet i bruk i deres daglige drift, er det avgjørende at løsningen også analyserer og dokumenterer effekten av rådene ProductionCompass gir.

With this, the aim is to improve and automatize how the earth's interior is interpreted. The candidate will conduct research on use of numerical methods for optimization of the filter algorithms. The motivation and overall goal is to develop automatic/semi-automatic interpretive techniques for seismic data.
Attention will be especially directed to the classification and interpretation of structural trends and stratigraphic sequences. Case studies with data from Lundin Norway AS, acquired in the southwest Barents Sea, will be implemented with the thesis work.
Imaging techniques that are similar to the geophysical reflection seismology (such as X-ray surveys, MR- and CAT-scans and echo sounding) are being used in different industries and image processing techniques used in other disciplinary fields will be exploited in this work. Such techniques are e.g. the non-local means algorithm for image de-noising, used in the medical industry today. Other examples such as face recognition techniques can also be mentioned.

Kravet til god kundeservice har blitt en avgjørende konkurransefaktor for tjeneste- og produktleverandører. Convertelligence er tidlig ute med å utvikle norsk språkteknologi som kan automatisere bedrifters kundedialog. Det er utviklet svært mange språkteknologiske verktøy for engelsk, men det finnes dessverre få liknende løsninger for norsk.

Vi bruker kunstig intelligens og maskinlæring for å tolke og forstå språklige data slik at vi kan automatisere kundeservice og kundedialog. Vi er i gang med utvikling av teknologi og har allerede etablert Visma som utviklingspartner og pilotkunde. Vi er også i dialog med andre store selskaper i Norge som ser behovet og besparelsene ved automatisering av kundedialog. Selskapet søker støtte fra FORNY for å dekke kostnader knyttet til utvikling av disse språkteknologiske løsningene.

Steinsvik AS har levert rundt 10 000 undervannskamera, og har derfor tilgang til store datamengder. Kameraene er utstyr med sensor for oksygenmåling, dybde-og retningsinformasjon. Alle aktivitetene og valgene røkter gjør, som start, bremsing og fôring, logges. Gjennom dette prosjektet ønsker vi å koble alle disse datakildene med oppsummerende egenskaper fra videostrømmene for å legge til rette for læring i form av at man trener en maskinlæringsalgoritme til å etterligne en røkter ved å predikere fôringsintensitet og stopp.

De mest sentrale FoU-utfordringene:
- Ekstrahere egenskaper fra video som beskriver fiskens oppførsel
- Utvikle algoritmer for automatisk vurdering av appetitt
- Deteksjon av uventede hendelser under fôring og selvlæring
- Forbedring av avbildende system

Samtidig med utvikling av appetittmeteret, skal Steinsviks fôringssoftware utvikles slik at det er kommunikasjon mellom fôrings- og kameraovervåkingssoftware hvor appetittmeteret skal integreres.

269345,Machine learning prognosis for system imbalance volumes (IMPALA),2017,2019,"The costs that TSOs have related to mitigating imbalances and frequency deviations have increased steadily the last 10 years, especially in the Nordics but also in many other regions around the world. The drivers behind the increase in the Nordics (higher intermittent production from renewables and tighter integreation with surrounding countries) in costs are expected to become stronger going forward. In general, the shorter the time frame that a system operator has to respond to a system imbalance, the fewer resources are available for mitigating actions and correspondingly the more expensive it is for the system operator to take action. In addition, in extreme periods unexpected large imbalances can lead to system blackouts, which can have a very high societal cost. Being able to forecast system imbalance volumes therefore has a great value to system operators. 

Currently, there are no effective tools available in the market for providing such forecasts. Additionally, published literature on forecasting system imbalance volumes is very limited and of a quality that leaves great room for improvement. 

The question that this project is designed to address is thus: How can we design an algorithm that is fast enough to be used in a real-time environment while at the same time providing a highly reliable forecast of system imbalance that can easily be updated as new knowledge becomes known?",Næringsliv,Næringsliv,4070000,Gavin Bell,OPTIMEERING AS,Oslo

269440,Demonstration of data-driven software for daily production optimization,2017,2019,"Summary

Oilfield operators need tools for automated analytics to leverage the large quantities of data being captured. Solution Seeker combines data processing, machine-learning and visualization into a real-time, automated, and data-driven advisory system for daily production optimization. This is currently being developed as a novel software product called ProductionCompass.

ProductionCompass is a web-based solution focusing on availability, low maintenance, user-friendliness and cut-to-the-chase problem solving. The solution is unique and technologically innovative compared to currently available alternatives. It consists of multiple production enhancing applications, such as automatically generated advice on how valves, pumps or pressures can be changed to utilize production system bottlenecks better.

There is a need to pilot test ProductionCompass through this DEMO2000 project.

The main objective of the project is to successfully conduct a full scale demonstration of ProductionCompass under normal operations, and document the value added compared to conventional methods. This will be achieved by testing three specific applications with varying degrees of complexity.

Main activities are development of pilot software, initial pilot testing with close follow-up from Solution Seeker and finally independent user testing.",Næringsliv,Næringsliv,5000000,Vidar Uglane,SOLUTION SEEKER AS,Oslo
269499,Generic Hydropower Optimization Using Deep Reinforcement Learning (GHO-DRL),2017,2020,"The project is motivated by the fact that the Nordic electricity market for the last two years has experienced a huge fall in energy prices. The reasons for this fall are many, but the undisputable consequence for the Norwegian hydropower sector is that income is going down and there is an urgent need to lower costs and run the operations more efficiently. To this end, there is a need for more practical applicable simulation software. However, traditional solvers based on linear and dynamic programming techniques have significant shortcomings in operational use.

The underlying idea in this research project is to apply and adapt recent breakthroughs in so-called Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to the hydropower scheduling problem. To our knowledge, this has never been done before. We will develop DRL based models, algorithms and an accompanying hydraulic-economic model that can utilize inexpensive and massive parallel computing platforms offered by Graphical Processing Units (GPUs). The new software will be tested in an operational setting at Agder Energi and compared to traditional optimization techniques based on linear- and dynamic programming methods (LP, DP).

Given the success in this project the value creation will be more efficient utilization of the water resources available at Agder Energi. Today this energy resource is about 4 percent of the Norwegian hydropower production and represents a huge part of Agder Energi's income. It is clear that even small incremental improvements in how water resources are used (1-2 %), will create huge increase in income for the Norwegian hydropower sector. Furthermore, societal costs related to flooding may be reduced with improved techniques for hydropower optimization.",Næringsliv,Næringsliv,1716449,Ole-Christoffer Granmo,AGDER ENERGI KRAFTFORVALTNING AS,Kristiansand
269521,EDIS - Effective Decision Making via Intelligent Data Integration for Conceptual Ship Design,2017,2020,"Effective gathering, understanding and handling the large amount of data involved during the ship design value chain is a challenge. It consists of not only data from the ship and its equipment, but a wider scope that should include stakeholders' expectations, subjective stylistic preferences, owner's requirements, previous design data, regulations, suppliers, shipyards, sea trial and operational data. The number of variables involved makes the data handling and sharing between departments, phases and stakeholders a difficult task, usually losing important information when such data is converted to slides and spreadsheets rather than properly manipulated. Nowadays, it is usual to have each process of the whole project treated independently by different groups, in a way that the information generated in each process is not effectively related and spread between different value-chain actors. This affects both ends of the value chain, increasing the number of hours during design (and consequentially cost), leaving room for communication issues, as well as delivering a lower value robust product, where the final constructed ship can be optimized to an different operational profile than it was originally designed for, operating super- or sub-optimised during its lifespan. Being able to deal with these issues in an efficient exploration of existing and related information across the whole lifecycle is essential to ensure the most value robust ship design value chain.

This project will develop a intelligent and improved data integration framework during the ship design process, aiming an effective mapping of data produced during ship design (model-based system), during all value chain phases (from conceptual design thorough operation and scrapping) that can be used as an effective decision support tool during early stages of design.

269555,Fleksibel Robotisert Elektromekanisk Montasje,2017,2021,"Automatisert montasje av produkter som består både av elektronikk og mekanikk er uvanlig i dagens industri. Dette er hovedsakelig på grunn av produktenes komplekse oppbygging, variasjon og relativt lavt antall som vil selges i løpet av produktets levetid. Slike produkter består som regel av en kombinasjon av små og relativt store deler. En del av de kan for eksempel bestå av ett til flere kretskort, kabler og kontakter som ofte skal loddes, skrues eller limes. Noen produkter består av flere små delprodukter som monteres sammen til større sluttprodukter. Disse oppgavene krever normalt nøye inspeksjon og evnen til å føle seg frem. Gode metoder for å lære en robot til å utføre disse typisk menneskelige montasjeoppgavene er ikke etablert i dagens industri. Det snakkes i dag mye om den fjerde industrielle revolusjonen, noe som betyr at maskiner vil i enda større grad kommunisere seg i mellom, og gjerne med selve produktet som blir produsert. Dette åpner muligheten for svært mange nye og mer fleksible robotløsninger. Disse kan lettere tilpasses og skaleres etter produkttype og etterspørsel i markedet. Roboter vil være avhengig av avansert kamera- og sensorteknologi. Dette vil hjelpe roboter til å forstå omgivelsene, utføre trygge valg og de kan dermed samarbeide med mennesker uten fare for liv og helse.

269809,Fast Development of new Automated Manufacturing Processes through digital integration and testing,2017,2020,"The project aims to achieve much faster development of new automated manufacturing processes through digital integration and testing. Digital simulation and virtual testing, verification and validation enable rapid and cost-effective learning cycles, and will provide the basis for a physical production process that is right the first time. Working methods and software systems that truly integrate both product and production process development will support and improve the cooperation between different organisation departments that work on the same product, but often in separate, consecutive phases. The production pattern of Rolls-Royce Marine is engineering-to-order, low-volume, often project based. Product and variant specific operations may be performed only once or a few times, hence such new and automated manufacturing processes have to be developed at a minimum cost, and as automated as possible.

The anticipated result of the project is to greatly reduce the time and cost involved in production process development, starting with a digital product model, and ending with a verified and proven automated production process. The outcome will include automatic programming of virtual production processes from digital product models; automatic programming of production processes on manufacturing equipment; and automatic data capture and analysis for physical product and production process verification.

Rolls-Royce expects greatly reduced costs in its innovation and manufacturing development processes, shorter product innovation lead time and faster time-to-market, risk reduction and improved quality on new product introductions, and a more flexible and automated manufacturing set-up.

269878,3D Cancer Genome Modeling for Personalized Medicine Diagnostics,2017,2019,"Cancers arise from mutations in a subset of high-risk genes, whose localization in the genome seems to be related to the underlying structure of chromatin. We seek to develop a computational framework for accurate estimation of cancer mutation susceptibility in the human genome, and following H2020 work, turn this platform into a cancer classification tool for use in precision medicine diagnostics and therapeutics. To this end, we have formed a Norwegian consortium of 3 partners at UiO (Philippe Collas; nuclear architecture, genome modeling, high-performance computing), OUS (Vessela Kristensen; breast cancer genetics, large dataset integration) and NTNU (Pål Sætrom, machine learning in genomics, gene regulation networks). We will establish, from our own genome modeling platform (Chrom3D), high-resolution 3-dimensional (3D) models of the human genome in cancer cells to infer relationships between 3D chromatin structure and mutation susceptibility. By modeling this relationship, we will then be able to generate probabilistic models of tumorigenic DNA variation; these models will constitute the basis for a highly performant tumor-typing software. 
The most relevant H2020 Thematic Area will be ""Personalized medicine"", with several putative calls already identified (see Annex). 
Our goals for this two-year project are ambitious, but we have already set up a working 3D genome modeling framework (Chrom3D) on which we are going to expand. We will specifically here: (1) Enhance the performance and accuracy of our 3D genome modeling platform; (2) Acquire preliminary data on 3D cancer genomes for, as model systems, melanoma and breast cancer cell lines; (3) Identify H2020 opportunities and new partners, formulate work packages, to send at least two H2020 ERC applications and at least one Thematic Area application in the 2017-2018 period.

Frivillige organisasjoner føler et behov for å ta et økende ansvar for omsorg knyttet til den voksende andelen syke og eldre i Norge og resten av Europa. De ønsker derfor å øke volumet på sine frivillige tilbud. Hovedutfordringen er at manuell koordinering av frivillige fra betalte ansatte gjør det dyrt å øke frivilligheten. 

Formål
Formålet med prosjektet er å anvende ny forskning innen kognitive systemer for autonom koordinering av menneskelige ressurser og frivillige. Systemet vil gjøre det mulig å koordinere et mye høyere antall frivillige med bedre kvalitet på tjenesten og et lavere ressursbruk. 
For å nå målet vil det være behov for helt ny forskning i skjæringspunktet mellom kognitive systemer og psykologi. Dette vil bedre forståelsen av menneskelige relasjoner for autonom matching av mennesker mot oppgaver basert praktisk og sosial egnethet for optimal fordeling av oppdrag. 
Data samles inn gjennom et verktøy på web og mobil (app) som Alder har utviklet. Verktøyet brukes av Nasjonalforeningen for folkehelsen og Kreftforeningen til å koordinere frivillige inn mot oppdrag og brukere. Systemet skal på sikt erstatte koordinator.

Utfordringer
Hovedutfordringen i prosjektet er å utvikle en forskningsskisse. Dette inkluderer i tillegg til nærmere definering av forskningsinnhold å utarbeide arbeidspakker, finne partnere, definere markedspotensial med mer.

This is a direct response to the Climate-ecological Observatory for Arctic Tundra (COAT) science plan stating that the circumpolar arctic tundra is the earth's terrestrial biome most challenged by climate change, but that there presently are too few observations of the arctic tundra. Therefore, there is a high demand for establishing scientifically robust observation systems to enable timely detection, documentation and understanding of climate impacts. 

The arctic tundra is a demanding region with severe weather, low temperatures, limited network services and energy, and often being physically inaccessible. This project advances the state of the art for cyber-physical systems being exposed to such extreme conditions. The Distributed Arctic Observatory is a novel next-generation scalable, energy sensitive, configurable, and robust observation system enabling many in-situ observations at high resolutions and at many locations throughout the arctic tundra, and with services making the data available and explorable by researchers and the public. 

There are many challenges facing such a system. The in-situ observation units must be made autonomous so they continue operation despite network limitations, faults, failures, and malware. Observation units have to use their limited resources in an energy sensitive way. Especially the analytics processing to find interesting objects in the observed data requires increased energy efficiency. To be useful in practise the system must be adaptable to new needs, and provide for access to data and for practical analytics and visualizations.",Universiteter,UoH-sektor,16094000,Otto Johan Anshus,Institutt for informatikk,Tromsø

These networked systems are composed of a large number of wirelessly interconnected components with local data processing and control capabilities over large geographic areas or with high spatial densities. The malfunctioning of one component, either due to accidents or intentional attacks, may have devastating effects. Unfortunately, currently existing scientific and engineering methods do not consider smart sensing and data analytics components, and proper integration methods to offer timely detection, cognitive control and adaptive learning and therefore, are very conservative and highly sub-optimal. INDURB offers a new complete multidisciplinary approach, providing the following features: a) a highly reliable and low-cost water health protection with respect to both chemical and microbiological contamination, predicting and reacting through actuation (chemical dosage, smart valves and pumps), ensuring that the water parameters are within the correct limits adapting to the application demands; b) improved decision making and future planning for service operations; and c) a real-time bidirectional interaction between our CPS and the end-users (water utilities, food and water consumers), which will also provide data into the system, interplaying with cost-benefit trade-offs and allowing an automatic end-user complaint surveillance to address water quality problems and improve satisfaction.

270738,Deep Learning for Health,2017,2018,"DeepHealth Phase 1 made progress towards developing entirely new ways to analyse patient data from electronic health records. This project will disseminate some of these results (concretely, present four peer reviewed papers at international conferences), as well as further develop some of these results/prototypes with the aim to investigate opportunities for building on these works for new funding proposals (e.g. H2020).

Background:

Vast amounts of heterogeneous and complex data from Electronic Health Records (EHRs) are ubiquitously being recorded at the patient level in healthcare (big data). This represents a largely untapped source of data-driven clinical information, having the potential to transform health and leap forward quality of care for the individual patient. However, this requires inference tools of much greater sophistication than traditional tools that often suffer from weaknesses such as oversimplified modeling and predictions based on population averages.

As a future and emerging technology in artificial intelligence and cognitive systems, deep learning has revolutionized analysis of big data in applied domains such as speech and image analysis. Similar breakthrough performance is realistic in health, provided that main challenges related to deep learning, especially in health, are resolved. This included the high dimension-small sample size problem (d>>N), heterogeneous source integration, and missing data. 

DeepHealth's aim is to move the research front in deep learning and artificial intelligence for data analysis beyond the current state-of-the art for the best quality of care. This will be achieved by a long-term research endeavor within the context of ubiquitous data and services in healthcare for prediction and prevention of postoperative complications, an enormous problem in health. The project will leverage vast amounts of uniquely available EHR data and clinical imagery from the University Hospital of North Norway, related to gastrosurgery and especially colorectal cancer, for which surgery is the only curative treatment. 

DeepHealth will perform analysis before, under, and after surgery jointly on unstructured and structured data, times series data, and imagery, for predictions of postoperative complications. Close collaboration exists with surgeons and international deep learning and computational health expertise, wherein high mobility will be key.",Ukjent,Annet,595000,Robert Jenssen,Ingen,NA
270791,Tools and Methods for Autonomous Analysis of Human Activities from Wearable Device Sensor Data,2017,2022,"AutoActive is motivated by the need for better tools, methods and algorithms allowing extraction of reliable and useful information on human activity from heterogeneous sensor data. Present commercial systems can mainly give a direct mapping between a single measurement device and single parameters, for example GPS --> location and speed, and heart rate --> effort. However, to design and optimize such sensor solutions and algorithms is a long, empirical process that requires a broad range of competence.

Access to this new level of information rely on 
- A physical and physiological understanding of the context and underlying processes,
- A careful selection and combination of sensor devices
- Data interpretation algorithms taking advantage of state-of-art data mining, machine learning and  other multiparameter analysis methods.  

An open source software platform will be realised and used throughout the project to develop knowledge on how to collect and interpret data from multiple wearable sensor streams. General project results will be applied in two case studies to verify the project approach and  methodology, as well as to demonstrate the potential of the technology. One case will be devoted to performance and technique assessment in sports, and one will be devoted to disease management for patients with multiple sclerosis.

270908,SANT: Sentiment Analysis for Norwegian Text,2017,2022,"Language Technology (LT) is a sub-field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) concerned with enabling machines to `make sense' of human language. A particular application of LT that has gained widespread use over the recent years, both for scientific and commercial use, is Opinion Mining or Sentiment Analysis (SA). The task of an SA system is to automatically identify the opinions, attitudes or emotions that are expressed by subjective information in text. This technology has been successfully applied for market analysis, political opinion analysis, reputation tracking, customer relationship management, news and social media monitoring, and much more. The main objective of this project is to provide open and publicly available resources for sentiment analysis for the Norwegian language, something which is currently lacking.

The project will take advantage of a peculiarity of the way reviews and critiques are typically summarized in Norwegian arts journalism and consumer journalism, viz. by an explicit rating on a scale 1-6, represented as a throw of a die. We here propose to use this feature for semi-automatically compiling a polarity labeled text collection. We can then use this to train and evaluate machine learned models for sentiment analysis on the document-level.

For some applications it is necessary to have models that can make more granular predictions at the sentence-level and identify the targets and holders of the opinions (`who means what about whom'). To enable such models, a subset of the review will therefore be manually annotated with fine-grained in-sentence polarity information.

In the field of AI in general, and LT in particular, the use of many-layered artificial neural networks (so-called Deep Learning) has recently seen as great revival with many successful applications, including sentiment analysis. The classifiers developed in this project will seek to push the state-of-the-art in large-scale sentiment analysis using deep neural architectures.",Universiteter,UoH-sektor,10089000,Erik Velldal,Institutt for informatikk,Oslo
270922,Advanced Analytics on Smart Data,2017,2021,"Over the last ten years, a new field of research has emerged: Big Data Analytics (BDA). Massively distributed systems offer new tools for exploring large datasets. In parallel, a steady increase in computing power and available training data has enabled the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to gain critical mass. 
The challenge of managing, investigating, and visualizing big datasets is not new in the fields of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM). Recent developments in BDA offer a new set of tools for overcoming these challenges, however, there are significant challenges that arise from the structural differences between most STEM data and the unstructured textual data typical in classical Big Data applications.
In order to address these challenges, we propose using Locally Refined (LR-) spline data modelling to turn Big Data into Smart Data. In early implementations of LR-spline algorithms in 2D and 3D, we have seen their potential as compact interactive models for visual and quantitative analytics on big datasets, well suited for hardware-accelerated interrogation and visualization. By spatial tiling and stitching, we have an extremely versatile and parallelizable approach, well suited for Big Data infrastructures. We can therefore include time and other relevant variables in a compact, interactive, multi-scale, higher order, locally refined model.
However, substantial theoretical developments are needed before this vision of LR-spline modelling of Big Data can be realized. ANALYST will provide the research platform to bring the theoretical foundation of LR-splines up to a level where their full potential can be explored, combining BDA and AI to provide advanced analytics on the LR-spline model. While the focus will be on data from applications in the STEM fields, the resulting algorithms have a wider applicability, providing highly scalable complex modelling tools for Big Data Analytics.",Teknisk-industrielle institutter,Instituttsektor,15545000,Tor Dokken,Mathematics and Cybernetics,Trondheim

Disse er vesentlig mindre og billigere enn instrumenter som brukes i dag. Men erfaringen var at disse fungerte dårlig i praksis for måling av utendørs luftkvalitet. NILU gjorde egne vurderinger av produkter som kom basert på mikrosensorer med tanke på å ta disse i bruk, men så da disse kvalitetsutfordringene. Der det er store endringer i vind, fuktighet og temperatur har mikrosensorer gitt upresise målinger.

To contribute to this field of high industrial and academic interest, we will establish a research community of critical mass (specialist circle) on human-chatbot interaction design. Here, we will combine and extend the state-of-the-art in human-computer interaction and machine learning. The specialist circle will have substantial impact through future European R&I projects (H2020), industry and public sector projects, knowledge networks, and education.

A particular concern in the project is to realise the potential of chatbots to strengthen digital inclusion. Given their low threshold of interaction through natural language, and easy access e.g. through chat services, chatbots have the potential to lower thresholds for digital participation across gender, age, and socio-economic status.

We will extend the state-of-the-art by addressing the need to establish and leverage knowledge of users and conversational context in human-chatbot interaction. For this purpose, we will apply machine learning to develop generative models and libraries of interaction patterns sensitive to user types and conversational contexts. Industry and public sector actors will be invited as data providers.

The integration of machine learning in HCI also represent a needed complement to this field. Machine learning enables the development of generative interaction models, which in turn can be used to simulate interaction patterns and drive the analysis and (re)design of human-chatbot interactions. This will allow future HCI to utilize available large data sets in analysis and design of interactive systems in general, and natural language user interfaces in particular.",Teknisk-industrielle institutter,Instituttsektor,15997811,Asbjørn Følstad,Software and Service Innovation,Trondheim
270941,Dynamic Robot Interaction and Motion Compensation,2017,2022,"The next two big steps in IOT towards 2025 is ubiquitous positioning for context specific data and services, and teleoperation - the ability to monitor and control distant objects.
The industrial need for tracking and manipulating moving objects in real-time has been identified through industrial and research projects. In this project, we will develop methods that allow the interaction and manipulation of moving objects in real-time. The motion of the objects is constrained, but their position, orientation and velocity are only partly known in advance and therefore a real time estimation is needed. The objects that we are going to act upon may be rigid or soft, and the force used in the manipulation of the object has to be measured and controlled. Lastly, the robot has to be able to do complex operations on the object whilst the object is still in motion thus requiring a complex path planning and path adjustments in real time. 
Painting of objects or welding of small parts on moving objects are examples from the manufacturing industry where being able to manipulate moving objects will be very useful. Inspection and maintenance in the process industry, either tele operated or by an autonomous mobile robot, requires close contact measurement on moving (vibrating) objects and has similar challenges. 
In healthcare, assistive robotics require safe interactions with flexible objects (humans). Automation of interventional procedures necessitates research on real-time methods for detection and compensation of motion, in order to safely interact with patients and health personnel.

These tools and techniques will build on recent technological advances in speech processing, language technology and machine learning, with the goal of enhancing the quality, efficiency and safety of emergency responses. 

The project will need to address several important R&D challenges. One major research effort will be the development of a speech recognition system for Norwegian able to transcribe emergency calls with sufficient accuracy.  The project will notably investigate how to integrate environmental noise, psychological stress and other emotional factors into the acoustic models of the speech recogniser. Dialogue modelling techniques will be applied to track in real-time the interactions between the caller and the emergency operator and automatically extract important pieces of (medical) information from the dialogues. Finally, the project will apply machine learning techniques to automatically predict relevant variables (such as the situation's urgency level or the most likely geographical position of the caller) on the basis of the information collected during the call, combined with various contextual factors. These predictions will be subsequently exploited to quickly detect potential errors, omissions or deviations from operational guidelines.

This project aims at enabling this technology for computer vision problems anywhere, by developing easy-to-use cognitive solutions also for non-standard images and thereby extending the use of autonomous cognitive computer vision systems to new application areas. The methodology will be general and transferable to other domains such as medical imagery, remote sensing and various industrial applications. Within the project the aim is to solve key big data computer vision challenges in the marine sector.

The overall concept of the project is to exploit the power of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) by developing new solutions for learning necessary to classify, localize and segment objects in non-standard, sparsely labelled, image data. Motivated by the methods' ability to generalize and the fact that unlabelled data is often inexpensive to acquire, our approach for solving this will be based on three main concepts; (i) cross-domain transfer learning, (ii) semi-supervised learning and (iii) data augmentation and simulation.

Fisheries and aquaculture are major industries in Norway, and marine image data are acquired in a wide range of formats and modalities for various tasks. Automatic solutions for extracting information from these big non-standard image data will bring exploitation of these data in the marine science to a new level, enabling extraction of new knowledge and continuous monitoring of marine ecosystems.

271080,High resolution wind farm simulations with CFD for Wind Resource Assessment and Forecasting,2017,2020,"Wind energy is a volatile energy source which is not always available when it is needed. Therefore, it is very important to have an accurate wind power forecast such that other energy sources can be used to balance the energy feed into the electrical grid.

WindSim AS has developed forecasting systems based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and based on Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). The ANN solutions are very efficient when the focus is only on predicting the wind speed at the turbine positions. But the power output of a wind farm depends also on the turbulence inside the wind farm and the wake effects between the turbines.

To model the turbulence and wake effects inside a wind farm the best physical description is a dynamical downscaling of numerical weather prediction models. Those models are typically run on a horizontal grid of several kilometers which is too coarse to describe the detailed flow field inside a wind farm. Downscaling those predictions with a CFD model we can obtain horizontal resolutions of around 10 meters. To be able to make meaningful predictions the downscaling should be run as so called transient simulations which makes it possible to calculate the time dependent behavior of the wind field and thereby the turbulence.

The purpose of this project is to establish an efficient meso-microscale coupling, answering the following questions:

- Can the TKE profiles from the mesoscale be used or is there a better formulation how to calculate the TKE inlet profiles?

- Can the turbulence prediction be improved by using more advanced turbulence models and can the wake prediction be improved by better models?

- Is Large?Eddy Simulation (LES) superior to Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulation or can transient RANS simulation work well for industrial application?

- What is the economic benefit of a meso-microscale coupling with regard to a better wind power forecast compared to the ANN methods when we consider the imbalance costs?",Næringsliv,Næringsliv,1619000,Arne Reidar Gravdahl,WINDSIM AS,Tønsberg
271323,Machine Learning in Economics,2017,2021,"Some of the difficulties faced by empirical economists is lack of data, and perhaps more specifically lack of data which is able in a detailed manner to identify complete decision patterns. On the other hand, computerization of companies and governmental agencies the last few decades have made it possible to record data on a large scale both with regards to high frequency time series, but also panel and cross sectional data. As a consequence, traditional methods are not sufficiently capable to encompass the complexity of these detailed data. Despite the application of some machine learning (ML) methods to economic problems, it is noted in the literature that ML and other forms of big data handling such as data mining not fully is embraced by the field of economics compared to that of the traditional econometric methods. 

The purpose of this project is to combine and apply econometric and ML methods to economic problems where big data, broadly defined, is available. While big data is a relative term depending on the contemporary computational power, the methods will be applied to both small (relative) and large data sets even while the data is not defined as big data, per se.

Challenges faced when doing statistical analysis is the data handling done by companies. Often, data is recorded in regular and predefined intervals. At the same time, it is stored without being used for anything else than displaying the raw data in figures and/or tables, if even that. Consequently, a job must be done with regards to facilitating and connecting the data to the implemented algorithms. This requires commitment from the companies. A long term goal of this project is to make companies better observe and acknowledge the value their data often contains, increase their knowledge with regard to what expertise to demand, and when.",Næringsliv,Næringsliv,1640000,Ingrid Kristine Pettersen,CAPIA AS,Tromsø

These image processing algorithms will constitute a unique, innovative & extremely complicated software programme to be used in conjunction with a pill camera.
There are a number of challenges associated with this project; for example, we presently do not have a camera & sensor which can be introduced into the human body, so we will need to create an artificial lab environment in which we can capture accurate video footage for study. 
Another challenge is that we need to identify sensor technologies which are capable of capturing the required amount of detail in the video footage. If the camera cannot see clearly, and the images are not clear, then it will be next to impossible to write accurate algorithms that will distinguish pathological areas from healthy areas.  
Another challenge is that this software will have to translate a doctor's experience & expertise in recognizing & identifying pathological states in the colon. The challenge is to properly identify the abnormalities on the image itself, to identify an aspect of that abnormality that can be measured in some way, & to then write algorithms which interpret & identify those aspects of a suspected abnormality accurately enough to make a dependable reading of the video footage possible.

Learning, with its principles and computational implementations, is at the very core of this endeavor. Recently, for the first time, we have been able to develop artificial intelligence systems able to solve complex tasks considered out of reach for decades. In most cases at the root of the success stories there are machine learning algorithms, that is software that is trained rather than programmed to solve a task. 

RegML is a 22-hour advanced machine learning course including theory classes and practical laboratory sessions. The course covers foundations as well as recent advances in machine learning with emphasis on high dimensional data and a core set techniques, namely regularization methods. These methods allow to treat in a unified way a huge class of diverse approaches, while providing tools to design new ones. Starting from classical notions of smoothness, shrinkage and margin, the course will cover state-of-the-art techniques based on the concepts of geometry, sparsity and a variety of algorithms for supervised learning, feature selection, and multitask learning. Practical applications for high dimensional problems, in particular in computational vision, will be discussed. The classes will focus on algorithmic and methodological aspects, while trying to give an idea of the underlying theoretical underpinnings. Practical sessions will give the opportunity to have hands on experience. In many respect the course is compressed version of the 9.520 course at MIT. 

The school started in Genova, Italy, in 2008 has seen an increasing national and international attendance over the years with a peak of over 90 participants in 2014. This year (2-6 May 2017) RegML will be hosted and organized by Simula in Oslo.

However, due to the speed with which online information spreads today, in combination with its immense volume, human monitoring of the Internet is completely infeasible, which gives rise to the need for an automated system. 

On the other hand, the requirements for such systems w.r.t. reliability, functionality, flexibility, and trustworthiness are immense. And while several approaches have been developed in the recent past, almost all of these attempts attack the problem purely from the technical side, generally using machine learning techniques. Our approach differs in that we study the problem from both sides, from the technical, but also form the human side by performing experiments and interviews aimed at understanding how people assess trustworthiness online, which content is likely to spread far, and why actors spread misinformation.

On the technical side, the projects aims to design, implement, and deploy an IT system capable of analyzing large amounts of online news, focusing on Norwegian news sites and international sites that are cited frequently. The goal is to track where specific news items first appeared and how they spread, study the spread of misinformation, and, by using the knowledge gained from the experiments, enable the system to distinguish between misinformation and factual news.

The overall objective is the prevention of digital wildfires via automated early warnings form the system, as well as enhanced preparedness for such events through intense study

272217,Advanced X-ray and neutron imaging of fractured and porous rocks,2018,2020,"In the subsurface, fractures can act as fast conduits for fluid transport, where the geometry of the void space (most notably wall roughness and aperture) determines the transport properties. However, flow-through of a reactive fluid may affect this, coupling flow rate, transport of dissolved species, and stress in the solid. The project ARGUS will develop time-resolved X-ray and neutron imaging applications to unravel geological processes related to flow in rocks.
Understanding the interactions between fluid flow and rock deformation has numerous fundamental applications in geosciences: groundwater movement, displacement of contaminants, geothermal energy, hydrocarbon exploration and subsurface storage of waste (such as processed water, CO2, or nuclear waste), and enhanced oil and gas recovery. Moreover, the transport of fluid in fault zones is also related to earthquakes, and how transport controls the occurrence of local chemical reactions and metamorphism at depth.
We will perform advanced time-lapse X-ray 3-D tomography to image the fracturing of solid rock under pressure/temperature conditions representative for hydrocarbon reservoirs. Using our knowledge from X-ray imaging, we will adapt and develop 2-D and 3-D neutron imaging for flow in fractures. Furthermore, tomography data image processing to date is dependent on the operator, where user bias decreases reproducibility and may introduce errors. Therefore, we propose to apply innovative segmentation routines, based on machine-learning algorithms, to quantitatively describe the 3D morphology of the growing crack network and the flow, and to minimize errors.
Developing in situ experiments and data processing routines will help us to build up towards usage of the new neutron imaging capacities currently being installed in Scandinavia. We aim to collect a database of reference samples and images of fractures and flow patterns in rocks that can be used for comparison between various X-rays and neutron sources.",Universiteter,UoH-sektor,3583000,Francois Renard,DET MATEMATISK-NATURVITENSKAPELIGE FAKULTET,Oslo

While current infrastructures are limited in terms of (remote) configurability and service differentiation, smart infrastructures will use a service-oriented view. This is a novel view where services, devices and systems will interconnect to provide added value or functionality, for example in the case of trusted connections for medical data, or secure and reliable communications in the case of an alarm. 

One of the major challenges in smart infrastructures such as home and buildings is the integration of applications that have a wide range of requirements. Current wireless solutions are based on best-effort Wi-Fi networks, and control of the network quality ends at the termination in the home. 

For the digitised life there is a requirement for standardised methods of seamless exchange of information and data between different types of infrastructure, systems and applications. The project will use different types of technologies and tools in order to automate such as machine learning, analytics, measurements with a combination of scientific methods to find proof of concept of how to predict quality in a wireless network and environment.

272523,Automatic FPI,2017,2017,"The problem. FPI on aerospace vanes 

Fluorescent Penetrant Inspection (FPI) is a nondestructive test method which is very effective in detecting porosity, cracks, fractures, laps, seams and other flaws that are open to the surface of the test piece and may be caused by fatigue, impact, quenching, machining, grinding, forging, bursts, shrinkage or overload. FPI is currently used at GKN Aerospace Norway (GAN) on lots of machined parts, in particular for stator vanes, and involves a several stages process where the part is cleaned and then dipped in a fluorescent penetrant bath. Then, the penetrant is removed and a developer (dry powder) is sprayed for pulling the trapped penetrant material out of surface defects and spread it out on the surface of the part so it can be seen by an inspector. After the inspection, the part is cleaned.
Some of these operations have been partially automated during the years at GAN, and today the NDI workshop is equipped with a crane for loading parts and dipping them into the penetrant tubs; however, the last part of the process is still purely visual and relies on the skills of the operator.
Due to the very high number of vanes produced at GAN every week (some thousands), the human factor becomes significative in this process, since inspectors cannot ensure long-term consistency in their evaluations due to fatigue, needing breaks and rest periods to ensure high quality output which are required when inspecting jet engines parts. Besides that, inconsistency is also observed between the outputs of different inspectors. 
These factors highly contribute to increase the cost of the process and to undermine its reliability.
The project proposes to develop and test a vision-based system for automating the FPI process, including artificial intelligence based algorithms developed for training the automatic inspection system and confirm its evaluation by comparing them with the operators? output",Næringsliv,Næringsliv,90000,Davide Caputo,GKN AEROSPACE NORWAY AS,Kongsberg

Alder utvikler en digital plattform for å koordinere menneskelige ressurser til oppgaver som skal løses i organisasjoner. Plattformen brukes i dag for å koordinere frivillige i organisasjoner og kommuner, men det er også et betydelig potensiale for å koordinere menneskelige ressurser i privat sektor. Grunnen til dette er at kjerneteknologien i plattformen bygger på kunstig intelligens for å koble profilene til personer med oppgaver som skal utføres. Dette er anvendbart i alle situasjoner der personer skal fordeles til en oppgave eller jobb. Siden størstedelen av verdens BNP skapes av personer som utfører oppgaver gir dette et enormt marked.

State-of-the art i dag er metoder innen maskinlæring som kan matche personer mot jobber og oppgaver basert på hard skills. Dette benyttes blant annet av Google Jobs API og Linkedin Talent Match. Alder benytter en type erfaringsbasert læring innen case-basert resonnering (CBR) som kan håndtere flere lag av abstraksjon og gjøre en mer helhetlig kobling av personer sine profiler mot en oppgave eller jobb basert på både hard skills og soft skills. 

Formål:
Formålet med SME1 prosjektet er å  demonstrere innovasjonshøyden og markedsmuligheten som ligger i Alder sin kjerneteknologi og utarbeide en klar go-to-market strategi.

However, the subjective interpretation, and hence detection of abnormal sounds has worryingly high variance. Currently there is also an increasing interest to use lung sounds in smart medical and home monitoring devices. However, lung sound analysis methods have mostly been developed and tested using small, and unrealistic, datasets and have therefore been of little practical use.

There is therefore a need for better tools to train future doctors and nurses. These tools can also be used by non-professionals. We are seeing more and more smart devices, wearables, and apps targeted for self-monitoring of various health metrics, including smart stethoscopes. These are also integral parts of the mobile platforms provided by Apple and Google.

In Tromsøundersøkelen we have collected the biggest epidemiological lung sound dataset in the world. We have had leading lung sound experts in the world annotate the recorded sounds. We have therefore been the first research group in the world that could develop deep learning methods for lung sound analysis using a big realistic dataset. We have already identified training and monitoring tools for our methods. We have already implemented prototype tools utilizing the analysis results, and our lung sounds experts are already evaluating these. Our solution gives our users the needed skills, without the need for human trainers. We know that there is interest to use such tools at the University of Tromsø (UiT).

We want to establish a startup. We will build and deliver a cloud-based platform for lung sound analysis, and implement a training tool based on our prototype.

We have built an intelligent customer assistance system, that enables any retail company to provide usable and reliable  conversational experiences for online shopping, something that chatbots combined with machine learning(ML) are not expected to do for the next 3 years. 

During the past year, our company has focused on parsing and fulfilling requests for online shopping with humans because machines are not yet capable of making decisions at an emotional level. They simply cannot beat human intuition when considering the context of a request, nor have common sense to understand the circumstances of the user and come up with fitting solutions. Glimty's vision is to keep building the technology that facilitates the operation and management of conversational shopping experiences, making our software easy to integrate into the business of any company offering a marketplace or online store. 

Current technologies are expected to advance, enabling online shoppers to type or command verbally their shopping requests to any smart device and receive options that fit what they want to buy, making the whole process easier and more convenient. The capability for processing the data that we collect to automate part of the human assistant process with ML will be commoditized in the following years. Technological giants like Google, Amazon and Microsoft will make it available as enterprise software, offering their resources to any company needing Artificial Intelligence in their applications or business.

Døve barn fødes i ni av ti tilfeller til hørende foreldre. Disse foreldrene kan ikke tegnspråk ved barnets fødsel og må lære dette tidlig for at barnet skal kunne følge normal utvikling. På grunn av  dette trenger hørende foreldre  støtte til å lære tegnspråk på et nivå som muliggjør normal kommunikasjon med barnet under oppveksten.

Globalt er det estimert at 70 millioner mennesker er døve, 80% av disse er totale analfabeter, kun 1-2% får opplæring på tegnspråk.  Hovedårsaken til dette er  at ingen hørende i nærmiljøet kan eller har muligheten til å lære tegnspråk. Av de estimert 210 millioner hørende som er forelder eller søsken til døve, kan mindre enn 10% tegnspråk.  

Studier har vist at manglende opplæring i tegnspråk også er et problem i Norge og andre OECD land.  Dette resulterer blant annet  i at 3/4 av døve barn er i den nedre kvartil i skolesystemet både på barne-, ungdoms- og videregående skole  til tross for at barnas mentale ferdigheter er på samme nivå med deres hørende klassekamerater. En vesentlig årsak til dette er  til mangelen på  god kommunikasjon og språkutvikling tidlig i barnets liv.

The time from when information is acquired to decisions are made is getting shorter, and the degree of details modelled in the power systems, and the amount of information processed,  is continuously increasing. In addition restrictions given by local, state-dependent, concessional and environmental conditions tend to introduce additional requirements to models that are applied in the planning process. 

In production planning, the power producer attempt to optimize the value of the available resources in a long and short term perspective. This is done by applying a wide range of models and commercial competence. A common challenge for the models applied in the existing planning process is the time requirements associated with complex modelling. The following models are used in the production planning process:

o Price models to model expected long- and short-term prices
o Long-term fundamental models to generate water values and weekly production plans
o Short-term models to create hourly production schedules and marginal-cost 
o Marginal-cost models to translate results from short-term models in the price-dependent nomination process.

The main tasks will focus on solving the identified, and capturing further, arising factors in scheduling.",Næringsliv,Næringsliv,1666000,Lisa Haukaas,HYDRO ENERGI AS,Oslo
273599,Patient-Centric Engineering in Rehabilitation (PACER),2018,2021,"In patient centered services, digital technological solutions will continue to have gradually more impact on Norway's health system. It is therefore a growing need to train healthcare personnel, engineers and designers to collaborate in such a multidisciplinary, complex field where human and natural sciences complement each other in patient centered services. This impacts all levels of the ""ecosystem"" of these professions, and the most specialized people, the doctorates, are essential. These doctorates have the responsibility to train and lead sub-projects, which can further involve graduates and undergraduates. A cross-disciplinary understanding is one of the key elements to succeeding and meeting new challenges with innovative solutions. Oslo and Akershus University College of Applied Sciences (HiOA) can educate and train doctorates, with the unique position of a multitude of professions - and with the right ambitions - to make collaborative projects across traditional fields. Central to succeed with this specific project at HiOA is the Motion analysis lab (Bevlab). The data from these patient groups is multivariate and difficult to comprehend, thus making the treatment and prevention strategies less effective. There is a need to develop hybrid models where sensor information combined with artificial intelligence tools provide patients and clinicians with simple information to adapt and make decisions, so that new and healthy behaviors are encouraged.The proposed project is a collaboration between several departments at HiOA, Simula Center, and Research Center CAIR at Agder University(UiA) in addition to international collaboration with the University of Southampton and the University of Washington. We seek, combined with our own funding at TKD, four PhD candidates.

273609,AMR-Diag: A Novel Diagnostic Tool for Sequence Based Prediction of Antimicrobial Resistance,2018,2021,"The emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistant (AMR) bacteria is defined as a global health problem by WHO. The situation is at its gravest in low- and middle-income countries, where antibiotic consumption is high and largely unregulated. Due to the lack of real-time diagnostics, prescription of the right antimicrobial at the right time is not always achieved. Time required for culture based identification of pathogen and phenotype-based identification of susceptibility to antimicrobials often necessitates unessential use of broad spectrum antimicrobials, which contributes to increase in resistance among pathogens. 

Accurate and rapid diagnostics that both identify the pathogen and provide drug susceptibility data in real-time would transform patient management and the current AMR crisis. Their application would reach broadly from primary health care centres to tertiary care hospitals, providing immediate guidance for therapeutic intervention thereby resulting in more prudent and appropriate use of antimicrobials. 

Taking advantage of the advances in whole genome sequencing (WGS), bioinformatics, proteomics and machine learning methods we plan to develop a decision-making tool AMR-Diag, for the detection of bacterial infection, including its resistance profile. The radical improvement comes from adopting Neural Network based learning for solving WGS data analysis problems. We will cover Extended Spectrum Beta-Lactamases (ESBLs) in Gram negative bacteria with focus on Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, and Acinetobacter. The developed method will be validated using characterized clinical isolates and finally will be evaluated on clinical samples for culture and culture-free identification of pathogens with ESBL resistance profiles. This tool will be easy to run and interpret results from, and will work on standard devices.

SCIA er en internasjonal konferanse av høy kvalitet, arrangert første gang i 1980. Konferansen arrangeres annen hvert år, og alternerer mellom de nordiske land. Proceedings blir publisert av Springer Lecture Notes. Hvert åttende år arrangeres konferansen i Norge. For eksempel, så ble SCIA i 2009 arrangert i Oslo, og i 2001 i Bergen.  

SCIA arrangeres med ""endorsement"" fra IAPR (International Association on Pattern Recognition). Hvert nordisk land har sin egen underavdeling av IAPR. I Norge er dette Norsk forening for bildebehandling og mønstergjenkjenning (NOBIM). I 2017 er det altså NOBIM som arrangerer konferansen i Tromsø, i samarbeid med UiT Norges Arktiske Universitet. Robert Jenssen ved UiT er leder for NOBIM og general chair for SCIA. SCIA er et non-profit arrangement for NOBIM, og økonomisk sett er målet med konferansen å ikke gå med underskudd.

SCIA er høyst relevant for IKTPLUSS. Blant annet kan det nevnes at mye av forskningsfronten innen bildeanalyse drives fram av utviklingen innen maskinlæring og AI med hensyn til prediktive modeller basert på nevrale nettverk (såkalt deep learning).

SCIA 2017 har invitert 5 keynote speakers, der to er fra USA og tre er fra Europa. Dette medfører ganske store reiseutgifter og utgifter til hotell.

Konferansen arrangeres på Scandic Ishavshotell, og medfører utgifter til dagpakke, bankett, leie av utstyr og rom, osv. 

De totale utgiftene til konferansen avhenger av antall deltakere. Per dags dato har ca 100 betalende meldt seg på. 

Hvis man tar utgangspunkt i 100+ deltakere til slutt, så er estimerte totale utgifter på nær 640 KNOK.

Estimerte inntekter ved 100 betalende, gitt prisene som er satt for å være på nivå med tidligere utgaver av SCIA, er på ca 490KNOK. 

Dette betyr en differanse på 150 KNOK i negativt resultat. 

Med søkt støtte fra ITKPLUSS reduseres underskuddet for NOBIM til 50 KNOK.",Universiteter,UoH-sektor,99257.72,Robert Jenssen,FAKULTET FOR NATURVITENSKAP OG TEKNOLOGI,Tromsø

275182,4D Computed Tomography of Porous Materials,2018,2023,"Computational microscopy is a hot topic in optics, promising to revolutionize the image forming process by actively employing sophisticated computer algorithms. High-resolution microscopy has until recently been synonymous with expensive, heavy and bulky hardware. In the X-ray regime, the lack of high-quality objective lenses has during the last decade prompted the development of lens-less imaging, based on retrieving images from coherent diffraction patterns. In this project, we shall further develop Fourier Ptychography (FP), which is a coherent imaging method relying on synthesizing a high-bandwidth image from a series of low-bandwidth images. Reflection-mode FP microscopy in the visual optical range will established - including a smartphone compatible demonstrator. We further aim to construct the world's first X-ray FP microscope, which we hypothesize will prove superior to competing coherent X-ray diffractive imaging (CXDI) schemes in terms of high resolution and fast reliable operation, because of the robustness introduced by the physical objective lens. High-performance computing and artificial intelligence will be integral parts of these efforts. An exceptional team with internationally leading competence within the fields of X-ray physics, optics and high-performance computing has been assembled. The project is of high relevance to the upcoming X-ray free electron lasers (XFELs), but also to the advanced study of porous and other functional materials.

This hinders the discovery of new crucial knowledge for society. COLUMBIA initiates a multidisciplinary research activity that will result in a cutting-edge customizable methodology that aims to facilitate rigorous evaluation of large ensemble of Earth system models. 

The innovative assessment tool will be based on combining Machine Learning with robust statistics and multiple process-oriented assessments, and aims to filter 'good' models from the rest and therefore increasing our confidence when synthesizing future climate change projections. The proposed work is well timed as the process for upcoming IPCC-AR6 has just began and the first batch of new Earth system model simulations will become available in early 2018. The proposed integrated evaluation method is at the forefront of international efforts in understanding sources of model uncertainty and producing optimized future climate projections. The project outcome will therefore have a broad international relevance for both climate modeling and observational community. Customizing existing Machine Learning techniques for climate science will also brings new opportunities and values to the computer science community. 

New scientific knowledge gained from the project will provide critical support for the climate science community as well important inputs for the IPCC-AR6. A unique close collaboration between climate modellers and computational scientists exists within Uni Research and the Bjerknes Centre, ensuring seamless collaboration in developing the new method.

The fragments were promoted by leading scholars; they were published by some of the most reputable experts in the field; many of the fragments allegedly “survived” advanced physical testing and were authenticated by palaeographers. The fragments became part of the DSS dataset, even though they are undocumented, unprovenanced, and forged. Traditionally, critical provenance research has been neglected in DSS research. In the official publication series of the DSS, Discoveries in the Judaean Desert, information and reflection on the provenance of the manuscripts and fragments is scarce.

“The Lying Pen of Scribes” represents a new interdisciplinary and holistic approach to the DSS and seeks to create a more comprehensive and multifaceted dataset. The project is guided by the following overarching questions: (1) What critical insights can be gained from the post-2002 DSS scandal, and how can these contribute to change Qumran studies and manuscript studies at large? (2) How do collectors, museums, antiquities dealers, and scholars “authenticate” unprovenanced manuscripts and inscriptions? (3) How is provenance constructed, how do narratives of manuscript finds continue to evolve, and how can information about asserted provenance (origin, acquisition, ownership history) be decoded? 

The main objective of the project is to produce a comprehensive resource of data, methods, and procedures for the interdisciplinary analysis of Hebrew and Aramaic DSS manuscripts and fragments through a combination of physical analyses, digital imaging, machine learning, study of scribal practices, critical provenance research and an exploration of the various media that shaped and circulated the narratives about the world’s most famous manuscript find.",Universiteter,UoH-sektor,12351000,Årstein Justnes,UNIVERSITETET I AGDER,Kristiansand
275752,"High entropy alloys for thermal, electronic and optical applications",2018,2023,"New seminconductor materials are required in many areas within renewable energy and energy saving as well as in electronics. One group of materials has so far avoided attention as potential semiconductors: high entropy alloys (HEA). They typically consist of at least five different metallic elements in approximately equimolar amounts and adopt simple crystal structures. HEA can exhibit unusual and promising properties for many applications, but up to now the main emphasis has been to use them as structural materials due to their strength, corrosion resistance and/or stability. The main idea of the present project is to initiate a systematic search for properties that are relevant for semiconductor-based technologies within the space of hypothetical HEA compositions. This space is enormous: not only is the number of combinatorial possibilities huge, but the freedom to vary the amount of each element around the equimolar quantity (e.g. 20% for five elements) explodes the number of potential compositions. This calls for a systematic, high-throughput approach where the properties of a large number of compositions can be investigated simultaneously. The HEATER project will do this both experimentally and theoretically. Multi-source magnetron sputtering will generate graded films with thousands of compositions represented in a single disk. A range of high-throughput characterization techniques will be used to map out several properties for composition ranges. Simultaneously, electronic scale modelling will be used to complement the experimental work using a host of state-of-the-art techniques. The optimization will be taken further with a machine learning concept, where intelligent data analysis is used to parameterize models that can predict compositions completely different from the usual suspects. If successful, this project will give a tremendous contribution to materials technology as well as to fundamental materials science.",Teknisk-industrielle institutter,Instituttsektor,9926000,Patricia Almeida Carvalho,INSTITUTT FOR MATERIALER OG KJEMI I OSLO,Oslo
275872,News Angler: Discovering unexpected connections in the news,2018,2022,"Journalism is in crisis, but new information and communication technologies (ICT) offer new opportunities. Journalists today have access to a wealth of digital information from news aggregators, social media, and open data providers in addition to traditional sources. These sources can be automatically analysed, organised, prepared, and stored with increasing semantic precision and connectedness. Theories and techniques from artificial intelligence and machine learning can be used to classify, label, cluster, detect events, and otherwise process news streams in meaningful ways.

Our research group is collaborating with a software developer of news production tools for the international market. Together we have developed News Hunter, a prototype tool pipeline that analyses news and social media messages and represents them semantically in a knowledge graph that is used to classify, label, and identify clusters of messages, potentially in real time. As in similar tools, the focus is on surface similarity: pieces of information are related if they are about similar things, or if they are treated similarly by similar people. While useful for many purposes, the focus on surface similarity may drown other important and interesting connections hidden in the information.

News Angler will therefore extend and build on News Hunter to support deep and innovative information mining that goes under the surface. We want to leverage the semantic news graph to identify interesting and unexpected connections between unfolding news events and prepared background information represented in the graph. To achieve this, News Angler will explore adapting, combining, and extending theories from analogical and other types of computational reasoning.

The theories and techniques that News Angler will develop potentially have importance beyond journalism, as an alternative to the surface similarity-based search and recommendation services that shape the information bubbles we live in today.",Universiteter,UoH-sektor,7040000,Andreas Lothe Opdahl,Institutt for informasjons- og medievitenskap,Bergen

In a clinical setting there has been great research interest in perturbations and dysfunction of the brain-gut-microbiota axis in functional gastrointestinal disorders. These new insights have been especially relevant to our understanding and treatment strategies of the widespread condition labelled irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The project addresses research challenges in the following five key areas (cf. the 4 Big Questions in Nature Outlooks, May 2016): (i) Brain structure and function and gastrointestinal motility in IBS,  (ii) Cognition and emotion in IBS, (iii) Microbiota profiles in IBS,  (iv) The importance of diet in driving IBS, (v) Patient phenotypes and identification of clinically useful molecular and imaging-derived biomarkers. For each of these areas, specific research questions will be asked and organised as Work Packages. For image analysis we will apply next-generation techniques behind an ongoing revolution in both clinical and preclinical imaging: the machine learning methods deep neural networks (DNN) and convolutional neural networks (CNN). In medical fields, deep learning techniques have recently been shown to outperform traditional image analysis approaches in a variety of applications.

276259,Realizing Context-aware Intelligent Mobile Services through Real-Time Indoor Location Tracking,2017,2021,"The widespread adoption of mobile phone platforms with ever more powerful sensors and processing capabilities has created new opportunities for context aware solutions. This type of environment will enable the user to receive information based on the location and behaviour of the user. Mobile recommender systems, acting as information analyzers, can support the decision making process of users by providing suggestions related to the environment the user is moving through. A key source of input information for recommender systems is the real-time location of the user (i.e., the real-time location of user's smartphone). Adoption of this approach has until recently been hampered by the lack of an accurate indoor positioning system for smartphones.  With an in-door real-time tracking system that can track the location of a phone with precision on centimeter level, recommender systems can use this high resolution location information to provide more accurate interest of the user to shopping items, analyze his/her shopping behavior, and offer better learning mechanisms for context-aware mobile shopping.

Recently Sonitor has developed a solution that will realise this much coveted level of accuracy using a low cost infrastructure and full backwards compatibility with billions of smartphone devices running iOS or Android. In this project, we aim at exploiting this unique capability of Sonitor Ultimate Sense in order to provide more intelligent context-aware recommender systems and consequently make the end-user more satisfied with his/her, e.g., shopping experience, using these systems.

276282,Uncertainty quantification and phenomenological knowledge: Predictive power of emulator models for tail behaviour of safety critical systems,2017,2021,"The project will seek to establish the necessary mathematical framework for introducing phenomenological knowledge in response surface models. These are fast running approximations of complex time consuming computer simulations or expensive physical experiments, based on limited realizations of the simulation/experiment and statistical machine learning. This approach is especially relevant for probabilistic analysis of rare events, such as structural failure in safety critical systems, where not enough data exist to rely on observations alone.

Some of the key challenges today relate to the rapid increase in structural complexity of engineering systems, together with the need for more accurate and reliable models to support decision making under uncertainty. Here, today's purely statistical approach is not sufficient. By introducing constraints based on phenomenological knowledge we believe that we can overcome these challenges, and develop the mathematical tools needed for probabilistic analysis of complex engineering systems in the digital era. It will thus form a basis for update of existing and development of future rules and recommended practices delivered by DNV GL.

The main focus of the project is to develop new mathematical tools. To demonstrate how these tools may be applied, some relevant applications from the Oil & Gas industry will be selected for numerical experimentation.",Næringsliv,Næringsliv,1660000,Simen Eldevik,DNV AS,Bærum

The cost of unstable grid and dirty energy was annually ? 65,42 Bn just for the kWh costs. For consumers and businesses the figure are much higher when including production stop and broken equipment. The transformation towards more non-buffer abled renewable energy, variable loads from electric vehicles (EVs) and modern house appliances apply more strain and volatility to the grid. The quality, redundancy and operation boundary conditions for the grid will be increasingly more important. It will be important to control is the impact EV?s charging and non-buffer able renewable energy have on the grid stability with respect to e.g. load, capacity, frequency and demand response of the total grid.

Our goal is to develop a system that increase stability and security for grids with variable loads through control and monitoring of multivariable parameters. Our solution is a combination of HW for electronical spectrometric, communication technology, big-data, charge point management and cloud computing. By controlling/monitoring the intersection point between grid and variable load the potential threats can be detected and isolated before it hits the main system. 
Today solutions exists for controlling a charge point or measure instabilities in a grid. The cutting edge application is however the combination of real time monitoring and control of consumption point in the grid. With deep learning finding the source of the problem, and react to the symptoms in real time reducing risk for rest of the grid. For hospitals, grid operators and big production facilities, this is essential to provide the needed conditions for operation.

277234,RINVE - Automatisering og robotikk i inspeksjon og vedlikehold,2017,2021,"Markedet for inspeksjon og vedlikehold er enormt og nødvendig innen en rekke bransjer. Blant annet er verdensmarkedet for ikke-destruktiv testing og inspeksjon alene estimert til 99 milliarder kroner i 2022. Inspeksjon- og vedlikeholdsarbeid er ofte preget av utfordringer med omfattende og arbeidsintensive prosesser i miljø med f.eks. kjemikalier eller støv. Automatisering og robotisering har ført til bedre arbeidsforhold, omveltninger og økt kostnadseffektivitet i mange bransjer. Det har så langt vært få automatiseringsløsninger tilgjengelig innen inspeksjon og vedlikehold, men dette er i ferd med å endre seg og det bare et spørsmål om tid før automatisering og robotisering vil være nøkkelressurser i inspeksjon og vedlikehold også. Hovedmålet til RINVE-nettverket er å bidra til å sikre at norsk næringsliv kan kapitalisere på de mulighetene som økt global og nasjonal markedsetterspørsel, ny teknologi, og forskningsbasert innovasjon kan gi innen automatisering og robotisering innen inspeksjon og vedlikehold. Målgruppen til nettverket går på tvers av bransjer og inkluderer sluttbrukere og eiere av stor infrastruktur, entreprenører og malerfirma, teknologileverandører, systemintegratører og andre tjenesteleverandører. For å realisere hovedmålet til RINVE vil nettverket ha fokus på å legge til rette for innovasjon ved å arrangere innovasjonsworkshops, utarbeide mulighetsstudier og faktagrunnlag, identifisere og utvikle verdikjeder, etablere samarbeid på tvers av bransjer og starte nye prosjekter innen blant annet BIA-programmet hos Norges Forskningsråd.",Teknisk-industrielle institutter,Instituttsektor,750000,Aksel Andreas Transeth,SINTEF AS,Trondheim

Consequently, many organizations face uncertainty in decision-making and problem-solving, which places special demands on ICT design. To cope with such knowledge problems, more and more organizations turn to intelligent technologies, which promise a major breakthrough in how organizations collect, analyze, and act on data and information. Reportedly, 78 percent of managers will trust algorithmic advice in making decisions. Yet old problems loom large. Evidence of fatal failures and repeat problems of control in adaptation of artificial intelligence (AI)-based technologies abound in press and research alike. Since no set of permanent solutions exist, such phenomena call for more research into the sociotechnical arrangements of algorithms, humans, and organizational practices.

This project takes an insider view from behind the scenes at a multinational firm in international maritime trade and its dealings with the design and adaptation of data-driven intelligent technologies. We take an interpretive, pragmatist perspective and draw on practice-based approaches to uncover the sociotechnical practices and processes which AI spring from. In particular, we are interested to develop a detailed understanding of emergent configurations of human-machine collaboration and feedback mechanisms as a source for data-driven strategic advantage. Despite much scholarly interest in both AI and the role of uncertainty, surprisingly little attention has been paid to the role of emerging data-driven and algorithmic technologies in shaping firms' knowledge practices and strategies under conditions of uncertainty.",Næringsliv,Næringsliv,1631940,Eirik Grønsund,ISERV COMPUTING AS,Flekkefjord

Through the EUROSTARS project we will deliver a fully configurable virtual workspace to aid the construction industry of residential buildings to finish projects on time, on budget and with the agreed quality. Any software and ICT tool needed for the whole construction lifecycle will be accessible through our platform, which will implement 5G technologies. A centralised data collection will allow the development of AI algorithms to improve project management, communication and software interoperability.

The SmartConstruct project is directly addressing the industry challenges that nine out of ten construction projects experience cost overrun; poor management and communication between project's parties together with lack of cost planning and controlling during pre- and post-contract stages. Moreover, the construction sector is lagging behind in the digital transformation and poor software interoperability has long been regarded as an obstacle to the efficiency of this industry.

SmartConstruct is well aligned to the EUROSTARS programme, which is designed to support research intensive SMEs with early stage high risk R&D-focused projects with a large potential market and a short route to market (< two years) which is a good characterisation of this project. The consortium brings together two R&D-intensive SMEs, Friend Software Labs AS (NO) and Forecast ApS (DK) with leading research capabilities from the Department of Computer Science, University of Copenhagen (DK) that will support the consortium in the development of AI algorithms.

For slike skreddersydde produkter utgjør ofte kvalitetssikring (QA) en stor andel av produksjonskostnadene. QA kan forsinke leveranser og medføre store direkte kostnader. Manuell QA er tidkrevende og krever høy kompetanse. SMB-er er gjerne sårbare for tap av nøkkelpersonell med påkrevd QA kompetanse. 
I senere tid har norske underleverandører til maritim og offshore industri opplevd stadig større konkurranse og høyere krav til kortere leveringstid blant sine kunder. De er nødt til å levere kundetilpassede produkter på betydelig kortere tid enn i dag for å kunne konkurrere i et globalt marked.  
I storskala serieproduksjon brukes maskinlæring for QA rutinemessig. Med løpende sensordata fra produksjonslinjen og moderne maskinlæringsteknologi er det store besparelser ved at systemet automatisk kan avgjøre om eventuelle avvik vil påvirke kvaliteten. For norske SMB-er, som er spesialisert på små serier og ETO produksjon, er en slik automatisk QA ikke tilgjengelig: Seriene er for små til å rekke å trene opp maskinlæringssystemet før bedriften må videre til neste produkt. 
Vi skal støtte opp om norsk industri gjennom å gjøre maskinlæringsbasert QA tilgjengelig for små serier av skreddersydde produkter.

280282,A New Traumatic Axonal Injury Classification Scheme based on Clinical and Improved MR Imaging Biomarkers,2017,2021,"Traumatic injuries to the head can cause differing degrees of damage to the brain, ranging from none to mild, moderate or severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). The management of patients with TBI depends on the severity of the injury and the primary imaging modality is still CT in the acute phase. But today we know that CT may only show the ""tip of the iceberg"" of the actual injuries to the brain, and in some instances the scan miss injuries altogether. In particular, traumatic axonal injury (TAI) is difficult to detect by CT. In the last decade, different MRI techniques therefore have been increasingly used. MRI can detect visible TAI lesions, but also other more subtle brain injuries, with a much higher sensitivity than that observed for CT.
In TAI-MRI, we aim to develop a classification system that can better describe severity of TAI and predict the outcome of injuries. The current classification system is based on neuropathological studies from 1980s and has been extrapolated to classify also injuries on MRI in surviving patients. This classification system has shown limitation in reflecting the actual burden of axonal injuries. A classification system that better reflects the distribution of axonal injuries and that also takes into account the prognostic significance of the different TAI lesions would help both doctors and health care professionals as well as patients and their families to understand the effects of brain injury and also what prognosis can be expected during the first year. To develop such an important and reliable classification system, researchers from four different countries will collaborate and data from three different studies including almost 1400 patients will be included and analyzed. MRI methods have been continuously developed during the last couple of decades, and new promising technological advances enable us to analyze MRI data in a more automated way.

The overall objectives are also targeted towards addressing some important topics under the themes of i) increasing knowledge about storage capacity, injectivity and the long-term effects of stored CO2, ii) gaining a better understanding of the mechanism that prevent leakage of CO2, and iii) increasing knowledge of how pressure build in a CO2 storage can be handled. The seal rock integrity and the overburden rocks will be analysed for proposed CO2 storage sites Smeaheia (east of the Troll Field) in the North Sea in order to identify critically stressed faults to predict slip on potential active faults as a function of pore pressure change or buildup, evaluate risk for fracturing, and risk of vertical and lateral CO2 migration. 

The project will be carried out as a collaborative effort between the University of Oslo, Norwegian Geotechnical Institute, Norwegian Computing Center, Colorado School of Mines and Curtin University with Statoil & TOTAL. OASIS will generate site specific seismic data derived 3D geomechanical models focusing on the overburden and seal rocks for the potential CO2 storage reservoirs. All the other necessary information (e.g. available cores, cuttings, wireline logs, laboratory test data, and pressure data from the wells) can be subsequently used to calibrate and iterate the models. In addition to the innovative procedure for the integrated computational 3D geomechanical modeling of the CO2 storage seal and overburden, caprock leakage potential, and the overburden pore pressure and pore fluid distributions from seismic inversion, the project will produce much needed high-quality hydro-mechanical data on overburden and cap rocks from advanced laboratory testing.

The main drivers may be associated with reduced construction and operational cost, as well as improved safety and environmental impact. This project will develop novel technological solutions for online (real-time) risk management and risk control of autonomous ships. Cutting-edge interdisciplinary research aims to achieve high level of autonomy, intelligence and decision making capabilities for autonomous ships. The goal is to enhance the realization of autonomous ships by developing safer and smarter automatic sailing systems and power and propulsion control systems that are able to detect, perceive, verify, monitor, control and follow-up deviations and potential hazards. 

Complex power and propulsion systems will be installed in autonomous ships. Advanced control systems introduce new types of failures, due to unforeseen interlocks in system design and functionality. If personnel are not onboard to operate, the ship needs to have safe and reliable onboard systems with high availability to be able to maneuover safely in the seaway. Shutting down and remobilizing the ship operation due to hazards caused by automatic or autonomous systems, including false alarms, are not economically viable, nor acceptable from a risk perspective. If sufficient system integrity cannot be ensured, highly autonomous and unmanned ships will not be realized on a broader scale. 

The knowledge building in the project will be decisive for the realization of autonomous ships. Specifically, the research results will lead to improved automatic sailing systems and power and propulsion control systems through the integration of risk modelling, machine learning, simulation, and verification of safe responses with optimization-based model predictive control (MPC).",Universiteter,UoH-sektor,10342000,Ingrid Bouwer Utne,NTNU FAKULTET FOR INGENIØRVITENSKAP,Trondheim

Cod heads and mechanically deboned poultry residues are two of the most underutilized by-products in Norway. These by-products are complex materials consisting of components such as proteins, fats, minerals, and other nutrients of high nutritional value for a globally growing population. If successfully processed into refined and tailor-made products, there is a great economic potential for high-paying markets. The proteins alone has an estimated 25 to 65% increase in sale price if processed optimally, as compared to the raw material. In recent years, enzymatic protein hydrolysis (EPH) have gained significant attention as a mild and versatile processing technology of animal and marine by-products. However, currently this technology cannot be used to take full advantage of the multitude of components in the by-products. In this project, we will develop a novel cascade bioprocessing technology that will solve this challenge. The cascade will constitute a combination of several different processing steps, each one aimed at giving separate products with the highest possible yield and quality. To be able to achieve this goal, we will combine research from several different scientific disciplines, namely bioprocessing and enzyme stabilization technologies, computer simulation and modelling, spectroscopy and analytical chemistry. By adopting the cascade bioprocessing technology, potential products from the cascade bioprocess can be formulated into a multitude of refined high-quality products for high-paying markets. To our knowledge, there are currently no companies in the world using cascade bioprocessing to facilitate full utilization of marine and animal-based by-products.

The project will develop technology for advanced perception and planning with deep learning capabilities that enables Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUV) to perform light intervention tasks semi- or fully autonomously (e.g., cleaning, valve manipulation), while ensuring that operators are kept in the loop.

To this end, SEAVENTION will deliver research and competence building on robust subsea perception with active 3D sensors, automated planning for UUV intervention procedures and augmented reality for UUV operator decision support. 

This is to meet the subsea industry's need for 1) more cost-efficient subsea solutions (autonomous UUVs, reduced need for surface support vessels), 2) increased competitiveness of Norwegian petroleum-related industry (enable them to offer the solutions of the future), 3) increased safety (less personnel offshore with autonomous UUVs, safe UUV operations, less dependence on highly skilled/experienced operators through new decision support systems) and 4) competence-building adapted to the needs of the industry. 

The main research challenges encompass 1) how to achieve robust 3D object detection and localization subsea, 2) how to merge high-level AI with low-level control for robust subsea intervention, 3) how to achieve dynamic UUV motion planning and decision making under uncertainty, and 4) how to achieve augmented reality for shared intervention control - in order to ensure the right level of autonomy and operator involvement in different subsea operations. Hence full autonomy / operator independence is in many cases not a goal it in self - the goal is to solve the right tasks in the right way.

280942,Advanced laboratory methods for cuttings analyses,2018,2022,"This project will explore the use of nano- and micro-scale techniques to characterise subsurface formations in order to improve drilling operations, logged data interpretation and large-scale geomechanical models. Such techniques will be applied to cuttings, readily available during most drilling campaigns. The ultimate goal is to be able in the future to derive petrophysical and mechanical properties of the overburden and reservoir while drilling, so as to improve pre-drill models and optimise the driller's choices in near real-time. In parallel, probing the formations at multiple scales will contribute to modelling efforts, where upscaling is dependent on high-quality input data for all constituent material phases. Such model predictions can in turn be verified by proper test procedures at the different scales (nano, micro and standard plug size). The biggest challenge to be overcome will be developing and performing advanced mechanical tests schemes combined with microscopy that allow correlating the macroscopic properties to the nanoscale structures. It will be difficult to determine whether this information is sufficient in order to upscale the properties and correctly predict behaviour at macro-scale. However, if successful, a method will be provided for drilling safely by adjusting drilling parameters on the way to target, with much more data than what is available today, based on few cores and lengthy tests. A market will be created for comprehensive testing on cuttings, continually produced as drilling progresses. It can be envisaged that with new upscaling models that we aim to develop, X-ray CT of well cuttings combined with indentation and acoustic velocity determination on rig to calibrate logs will be sufficient to continuously monitor and optimise the drilling process.",Teknisk-industrielle institutter,Instituttsektor,10674000,Ragnhild Skorpa,SINTEF INDUSTRI AVD TRONDHEIM S P AND VEI,Trondheim
281018,Remote Inspection of Wooden Utility Poles,2018,2022,"Remote sensing has been successfully used for surface monitoring of electricity power lines, poles, transformers and other equipment so that defects are discovered and power supply interruptions are reduced. Nevertheless, remote sensing technologies and techniques are still facing the complex task to effectively screening the inside of the infrastructure and detect hidden defects, for example, rot inside utility poles and over and underground, thus, hardly any non-visible damage and defects can be recognized without to destructively reveal them.
This competency building initiative is devoted to establishing a benchmark concept and methodologies for airborne remote sensing of subsurface defects in large and complex infrastructures, specifically, of wooden utility poles within the electricity transmission and distribution network. The ambition of RIWUP is to lay the foundation to enable that all poles are in service to their true remaining useful lifetime and preventing unpredicted failure. 

Today, the safety and serviceability of the WUPs depend on relatively sparse periodic inspections based on human inspectors and do not provide a high degree of confidence on the condition and useful life while still having dangerous poles in service. 
In a close collaboration with NMBU, Teknova has conceptualized a new method for remote inspection based on in-depth understanding of pole rot signals and the mathem. and statistical structures in them. This initiative strives for airborne scanning using a compact multi-modal sensing (i.e. visual, infrared thermal, radar tomography, and laser absorption spectroscopy) for collecting data from long distances and uncovering rot.

The industrial partners are engaged in this initiative for field evaluation of the new knowledge detection of rotten wooden poles and estimating its remaining useful life.

281148,MarinRobotics - Active Robot Vision to enable Automated Sorting and Handling of Compliant Marine Raw Materials,2018,2019,"One of the greatest challenges in the Norwegian marine industry is the lack of technological solutions for an automated sorting and handling of marine raw materials. Many harvesting and processing tasks in the marine industry are still manual based such is the example of roe, milt, and liver sorting in whitefish industry, sorting and post-trimming operations in both whitefish, pelagic and other sectors. As a result, only a portion of marine resources are efficiently used. To enable a higher harvesting sustaniability, resource efficiency and monitoring there is a need for automated solutions for sorting and handling based on 3D robot vision.  

Development of novel concepts for robotic automation in marine industry such as sorting and manipulation involves a robot being able to interact (e.g. by grasping ) with compliant objects, such as fish, fillets, or fractions such as heads, roe, milt and similar. These objects typically move or deform when interaction/manipulation is initiated. Given a 3D image by a depth camera, one can compute the interaction vector (e.g. for the grasp), for the object of interest. Once the interaction has begun the object may become partially occluded and begin to move and deform. For this interaction phase an active perception with robot by means of 3D visual servoing is necessary to have a complete overview of the 3D structure of the object and to be able to handle occlusion and deformation. Research activity in MarinRobotics project is therefore aimed at giving a robot the kind of interaction intelligence that human workers have and to enable a robot to 'see' better so that robots can work in a 'sense-think-action' manner in the same way skilled human operators do when they perform sorting/manipulation of marine raw materials. 

This leads us to the following hypothesis that will be investigated:

-Active perception by means of 3D visual servoing improves object's 3D exploration and correct 3D localization during sorting/manipulation.",Teknisk-industrielle institutter,Instituttsektor,107374.74,Ekrem Misimi,SINTEF OCEAN AS,Trondheim

Dette skal realiseres gjennom å etablere en digital tvilling av distribusjonsnettet som vil muliggjøre automatisering og optimalisering i sanntid. Løsningen skal bidra til å optimalisere utnyttelsen av infrastrukturen gjennom å automatisere koordinering, kontroll og styring av dataflyt og energiflyt. Hovedbestanddelene vil bestå av en sanntidssimulator med en harmonisert og dynamisk informasjonsmodell i en moderne sikkerhetsarkitektur realisert på en dedikert digital plattform. En slik løsning vil tilgjengeliggjøre informasjon gjennom å frikoble datalaget og applikasjonslaget med åpne grensesnitt og standarder. Dette åpner for redusert leverandørmakt, men også nye samarbeidsmuligheter mellom aktører. Markedet for KogniGrid vil være nettselskaper og applikasjonsleverandører til nettselskapenes IT-systemer. Plattformen gir også muligheter for å bygge innovative løsninger mot andre løsninger og mot sluttbrukersiden 
 (forbrukerfleksibilitet) på en kostnadseffektiv måte. 

De sentrale forskningsutfordringene for å etablere en slik løsning vil være relatert til:
- Innovativ bruk av sanntids simulatorer og modeller samt nye databaseteknologier for å representere distribusjonsnettet for de nye behovene (feks. bruk av grafdatabaser for effektive søk i komplekse nettstrukturer).
- Med utgangspunkt i state-of-art teknologi fra drift av transmisjonsnett, utvikle tilpassede verktøy for tilstandsestimator og utfallsanalyser slik at driften kan automatiseres og predikteres.
- Undersøkelse av alternative systemarkitekturer som ivaretar sann tidskrav.
- Hypotestesting gjennom proof of concepts hos nettselskap og forsøk i smart grid laboratoriet hos Sintef/NTNU.

The current practice is a substantial and growing cost factor for the health system and anything that will keep people longer at home will have significant socio-economic benefits. At the same time the quality of life and end-of-life care, and burden on caretakers at home must be carefully considered. This also includes ethical decision making, advance care planning, and proper assessment and treatment of pain and distressing symptoms. 

HORIZON 2020 Work Programme (2018-2020) encourages researchers, public care providers, end-users and industry to build sustainable health services for the ageing population. The main aim of our proposed project, CombHI, is to develop the background needed to successfully submit applications to large international collaborative projects, combining Health & ICT approaches.

Dessuten må pasienter og befolkningen forøvrig få mulighet til å se og forstå slike data slik at de selv kan styre helseatferd og bruken av helsetjenester. 

Et vesentlig hinder for oppskalering og implementering av slike løsninger er knyttet til usikkerhet rundt håndtering av sensitive personopplysninger, samt dårlige og lite standardiserte brukergrensesnitt. I tillegg kommer en rekke endringer knyttet til data og personvern i EU/EØS området som vil få betydning for hvordan digitale, persontilpassete helsetjenester vil kunne utvikles i årene fremover.

Exabel's innovation is an intelligent modeling platform that uses state-of-the-art Artificial Intelligence methods and mathematical modelling techniques to help investors turn the massive streams of data into actionable insights.

The FinAI project will conduct the necessary research for the modeling platform. Our system will support analysis across thousands of exchange-listed companies to surface insights that are tailored to our end users' needs. This will be achieved by an automated model-building framework supporting various types of models at a massive scale.

The main issue is one of generating relevant insights from the raw data flows: processing the data inputs effectively and then building models that best explain the observable patterns in financial markets. We have structured two areas for which research is needed:
1) Extracting structured information from natural language (NLP)
2) Quantifying the effect of information through model building

The tool will be optimized for model building on large non-homogenous data sets.

282040,Use of deep learning and Big Data in the Norwegian Breast Cancer Screening Program,2018,2022,"Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women in Norway and worldwide. Since the cause of breast cancer is not known, mammographic screening is offered as a secondary prevention, aimed at reducing the mortality from the disease. About 500 000 women have participated in the Norwegian Breast Cancer Screening every second year since the program was made nationwide in 2005. 

The radiologists spend a substantial time interpreting screening mammograms of healthy women, as about 7% of the exams are discussed at consensus, 3-4% are recalled for further assessment and 20% of those recalled, 0.6% of the attending women, are diagnosed with breast cancer and additional 0.17% are diagnosed before the next screening. 

By exploiting machine learning in the process the aim is to reduce the recall rate, the rate of missed screen-detected and interval breast cancer and obtain knowledge which can help us reducing overdiagnosis and overtreatment, which again will reduce the disease specific mortality. By achieving this goal, we will be able to reduce the human and financial burden of mammographic screening. 

A realistic ambition is that 100 women will get a breast cancer diagnosis 1-4 years earlier. An on-the-fly control of the image quality may reduce the number of recalls of 1 200 women annually and also improve the image quality in the further assessment.  

The project take advantage of three main factors: There has been a revolution in machine learning, also on medical images where machine learning together with experts is better than only human expertise. Our database with mammograms is at least 20 times larger than any published study. This is critical for machine learning. We will focus on questions that are relevant for the Norwegian Breast Cancer Screening Program.

Prosjektet Robust Industriell Transformasjon (RIT) adresserer dette gjennom nye løsninger der man fra designfase og til nye produktkonsepter utvikler og øker den endelige merverdi for bedrift og brukere basert på virkelige data.

Konkret har RIT sitt utspring i HSP-prosjektet (Håndtering av store datamengder i produktutvikling), et kvalifiseringsprosjekt medfinansiert av Oslofjordfondet. Her har man sett på forutsetninger for at data fra ulike kilder (eksempelvis fra LINCOLN-plattformen) skal kunne brukes i en konkret designkontekst.

This project seeks to meet the industry's need for an intelligent, reliable tool that can improve the evaluation and prediction of fish growth and health, and thereby increase revenues and cut operating costs.
 
A study performed at Uni Research Center for Big Data Analysis revealed that a machine learning approach can successfully be used to predict fish growth (weight and length) by intelligent integration of relevant data from different sources. Our tool, named Predict-fit, can, by using an unique and novel machine learning approach, identify the causal and correlation relationship between factors that influence fish growth, health and disease. This suggests that Predict-fit can be used to improve biomass estimation, that will increase operational planning accuracy and profits. This new control of fish health evaluation and prognosis will support proactive measures and reduce loss.

De nye koblingsproduktene vil øke systemets pålitelighet, sikkerhet og miljøpåvirkning. Med en ny kvalitetssikker kobling uten noen form for lekkasje, og med et produksjonssystem som tilfredsstiller bilbransjens høye krav, vil bruken av luftfjæringer kunne spre seg til vanlige biler i personbilmarkedet, ikke bare premiumsegmentet som i dag. Dette er et marked i vekst, og personbiler ventes i fremtiden å være det største markedet for luftfjæringer. Kongsberg Automotive Raufoss produserer i dag utelukkende til nyttekjøretøy, men ved å gå inn i personbilmarkedet vil bedriften både kunne vokse og diversifisere sin portefølje.
Dette vil kreve forskning innen flere områder som sprøytestøpeteknologi, dataanalyse, maskinlæring, materialteknologi, prosesskontroll, sensorikk og sporbarhet.

But current chatbot solutions often fail due to strong technology push with insufficient sensitivity to user needs, and a lack of service design that match AI and machine learning capabilities with users' needs and wants. 

In Chatbots for Loyalty, we apply a human-centred approach to innovate chatbot services that strengthen customer loyalty with service providers. We will develop AI capabilities for chatbots to predict and act on customer's likely next best actions. The AI capabilities will be incorporated in service processes where the chatbot is seen as a main point of contact for the customer, integrating service provider offerings. 

The project results generate value on three level. Project owner Anzyz Technologies will adapt its AI technology to the chatbot domain.

This will be achieved by introducing a new business model, based on a framework for technology assessment and verification of fuel savings and emissions reduction. This framework will be used to change established practices for financing new technology, and will introduce a novel way of collaboration between ship owners, charterers, technology providers, financial institutions, cargo owners and third-party assurance providers. This will accelerate uptake of technology for the benefit of ship owners, charterers and technology providers, while reducing the risk for investors.
Technical and operational measures such as alternative fuels, hydrodynamics, machinery and speed reduction will be considered. Technology assessment tools, based on AIS data and advanced models will be developed. Standardized methodologies for verification of the performance, fuel savings and emissions reductions from each technology will be established, and relevant clauses for charter contracts will be proposed.",Næringsliv,Næringsliv,5400000,Hendrik William Brinks,DNV AS,Bærum
282315,AutoCap: Automatic Anomaly Detection in Video Capsule Endoscopy,2018,2020,"Gastrointestinal (GI) diseases are largely influencing quality of life with almost 3 million new GI cancers per year. The mortality is about 65%, but it is heavily influenced by early detection of neoplasia, where a 1% increase in detection can decrease the risk of cancer with 3%. For example, colon cancer is the third most common cause of cancer mortality, and it is a condition where early detection is important for survival, i.e., going from a low 10-30% 5-year survival probability if detected in later stages (III-IV) to a high 90% survival probability in early stages (I-II). Screening on a regular basis is therefore recommended, and the Norwegian Government has therefore decided to implement a national bowel screening program for 55 year old citizens starting from 2019 and providing full coverage by 2024. Colonoscopy will be a cornerstone in this program. This is a very important goal, but hard to reach with the current personnel and equipment. 

Some parts of the GI system is hard to reach with traditional endoscopy examinations like the small intestine, existing procedures does not properly scale to the recommended screening program, gastro- and colonoscopy examinations introduce discomfort for patients and the cost per examination is high. In this respect, several manufacturers now provide video capsules (pills) where the medical experts analyse the video of (parts of) the GI tract offline. This analysis, however, takes long time and going fast forward increase the probability to overlook important anomalies. Therefore, automatic analysis and anomaly detection in VCE videos will be crucial for success.

The goal of this project is to develop such a system, combining latest video technologies with different types of artificial intelligence, able to detect multiple diseases with a high accuracy enabling a more efficient public health care system in order to reach the required scale and cost efficiency.",Næringsliv,Næringsliv,3886236,Pål Halvorsen,FORZASYS AS,Bærum

282395,"Machine Learning Models for the
Surveillance of Physical Power Markets",2018,2021,"The goal of our project is the development and implementation in software of machine learning models for the operative surveillance of physical power markets. The developed models and software will be designed to run automatically and be used by power market regulators such as NVE, market operators, brokers and TSOs in their daily surveillance activities in physical power markets, and by market actors trading in physical markets to monitor and regulate their own trading activities. 

Power markets often exhibit low elasticity of demand. In combination with large and flexible power storages (e.g. hydro power and, increasingly, batteries in combination with renewables) this results in market places that are particularly vulnerable to abuse. Surveillance of markets with high renewable and storage penetration is especially complex and difficult. Auction markets where all participants face the same price may be particularly exposed, especially in periods with congestion. 

Currently, most models and tools used for market surveillance in the power market based on sets of rules used to define market abuse scenarios. Rule-based approaches have several weaknesses, such as a tendency to produce large volumes of alerts, an inability to assess and priories the alerts produced, and difficulty in catching new behaviours. 

Machine learning is well suited for such monitoring, and can execute much more effectively than rules alone. The monitoring will be more automated, produce more relevant alerts (and fewer false positives) and enable users to detect market behavior that would otherwise be obscured. Such tools will also be more robust, since they will be less dependent on specific persons. This will in turn enable more effective and efficient mitigating actions to be planned and and taken, increasing the transparency and efficiency of the power system, especially given increased use of storage and renewable generation.",Næringsliv,Næringsliv,4748000,Gavin Bell,OPTIMEERING AS,Oslo

283002,Using Machine learning to reduce energy usage in buildings,2017,2021,"Somewhere between 30 and 40% of the global energy consumption occurs in buildings (United Nations Environment Programme, 2007). Thus, buildings represent an important opportunity to reduce energy consumption, and further help mitigate global warming, one of the world's most important problems. Most of the energy in buildings is used to maintain air quality and the right temperature inside the buildings. This is controlled by cooling, heating and ventilation systems, known as the technical building system. When this system is not efficiently operated, more energy is required, which will incur higher energy cost, service costs and CO2 emissions. Additionally, a non-efficiently operated building system will have a lower expected lifetime. Using unique smart-meter energy data from more than 50 million hourly observations; the proposed project will demonstrate how automated statistical methods and big-data techniques can help building owners lower their energy consumption and reduce maintenance costs. To accomplish this the project will conduct research within three different areas. First, maintenance costs constitute a significant percentage of expenses in most buildings. A typical (reactive maintenance) strategy is ""wait until something breaks"". Using machine learning (predictive maintenance) we will demonstrate how to reduce maintenance cost, and increase lifetime of the technical building system. Second, peak load tariffs are steadily increasing. Using predictive analytics, we will show how forecasting energy usage can be used to shift energy consumption from the main power line to locally produced solar and battery storage during peaks hours. These methods can reduce total energy costs, and peak shaving / phase shift can increase the lifetime of the power grid. Third, and last, the project will demonstrate how to benchmark energy consumption using machine learning and mathematical programming.",Næringsliv,Næringsliv,1688000,Petter Arnestad,OHMIA RETAIL AS,Trondheim

However, both freight transport and individual mobility in urban areas are increasingly reaching its limits since the process of urbanisation has caused continuous rising demand for urban mobility systems. 
The project will demonstrate how digitalisation of the transport system may result in significant improvements both in economic, environmental and social terms. The application of information and communication technologies (ICT) and Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) can make transport safer, more efficient and more sustainable for all modes of passenger and freight transport. Moreover, the integration of emerging technologies can create new services and are key to support jobs and growth in the transport sector.
The project will contribute to new scientific knowledge and practical experiences by use of an urban mobility lab for data driven policy developments. The project has access to a unique combination of data for passenger mobility and freight transport and, to a computational infrastructures and expertise in computational sciences & data analytics which is combined with knowledge in transport economics.",Miljøinstitutter,Instituttsektor,8000000,Frants Gundersen,TRANSPORTØKONOMISK INSTITUTT Stiftelsen Norsk senter for samferdselsforskning,Oslo
283349,Digital capabilities and passenger benefits of a seamless and resilient Norwegian airport system,2018,2021,"This project assesses the impact of digital aviation technologies on the passenger journey in order to improve their experience and the effectiveness of the Norwegian airport system. The project is relevant to the second area of the Research Council's grant programme on digitalisation of the transport sector. It seeks to expand and generate new knowledge about the impact of digitalisation on processes, organisation and competence needs in the air transport sector. The mixed methods approach to be taken by this project will also help to develop scenarios for the efficient and effective implementation of digital technologies in the airport environment in order to achieve seamless passenger journeys and commercial benefits for airports and their stakeholders - thereby contributing to the development of a more sustainable Norwegian airport system. Key challenges:

1. Methodological approaches to digital aviation remain engineering and systems oriented with a focus on quantitative methodologies. This overlooks the management, organisational and user welfare dimensions, which may require a multidisciplinary and mixed methods approach.
2. There are a lot of digital solutions available in the market. There is however little understanding on the influence that these technologies have on airport business efficiency and it is not always easy to measure the benefits of their implementation. 
3. The digital traveller experience is highly fragmented and inconsistent. Decision-making processes for the implementation of digital technologies require a door-to-door approach considering integrated multimodal solutions.
4. The contribution of digital passenger solutions in crisis management for situations of disruption is inconsistent. It is not clear how these solutions can help to increase the resilience and recovery of a network after it has been affected by a major disruption.
5. Future digital scenarios have significant unsolved challenges in the area of ethics and privacy.",Andre høyskoler,UoH-sektor,7000000,Nigel Halpern,HØYSKOLEN KRISTIANIA - ERNST G MORTENSENS STIFTELSE,Oslo

283556,Persistent Passion for Professional Education - Consequences for student completion and dropout,2018,2022,"This project examines higher education (HE) dropout, with a particular focus on professional education, such as in nursing, teaching and social work. The project consists of four work packages.

WP1 analyses registerdata to chart differences and similarities across programmes and disciplines in completion and dropout, and to provide in-depth knowledge about the professional degrees in focus. Further, through comparative analyses of Danish and Norwegian registerdata, we will improve the understanding of differences and similarities across HE-systems.

WP2 aims to test Tinto's paradigmatic model for student departure, by using StudData to explore issues of commitment and integration. Commitment will be operationalized as professional commitment and job values, which is measured both at the start and at the end of the program. Hence, providing a unique opportunity to investigate how well Tinto's model work in other HE-settings other than the US one.

WP3 has a qualitative approach, focusing on students' academic experience, their experience of professional placement and possible implications of their experiences for retention and completion. By mirroring a similar project in the UK, interviews with students and academic staff will be used to identify concerns and challenges nursing students face, prior to entry and during their HE-career. To ensure comparability we will collaborate closely with the researcher who conducted the UK study.

WP4 compares labour market outcomes of programme completers and non-completers, and we assess labour market implications of non-completion. Registerdata makes possible analyses of the outcomes labour market status, employment, income and occupation. These analyses will be compared to similar analyses of Danish registerdata, to examine whether country differences in completion rates may be partly explained by labour market differences in the two countries.",Universiteter,UoH-sektor,12000000,Håvard Helland,Senter for profesjonsstudier,Oslo

The workshop is non-profit and will be organized at UiT The Arctic University of Norway. Robert Jenssen, the head of the Machine Learning Group at UiT, will be the General Chair, with Michael Kampffmeyer (UiT) and Arnt-Børre Salberg (Norwegian Computing Center) as the co-chairs. Jenssen has previously been the General Chair for SCIA 2017, which also received IKTPLUSS funding and was a success. The group has several projects ongoing related to ICT and funded over IKTPLUSS, and this workshop will benefit those projects.
The workshop program will consist of presentations and poster sessions, where participants can present recent work. Participants that would like to present their work will be asked to submit a one-page abstract. Additionally, there will be a panel discussion, where issues and recent developments in the field will be discussed.
We have invited 5 high-profile keynote speakers. This will contribute to the quality and also increase the visibility of the workshop. However, this also leads to expenses, such as plane journeys and hotels, that need to be covered. We estimate these costs to be 50 000 NOK.
In addition to this, we will use the conference organizing company Xtenso AS, who will provide help with setting up registration (e.g. credit card payment, budgets). Overall, we estimate a total of 40-50 participants, which would result in an overall direct cost of 155 KNOK (see budget below).
To cover these costs, UiT The Arctic University of Norway contributes with 22KNOK (20 hours at an hourly rate of 1100,- NOK) of Jenssen's salary. Additionally, 80 KNOK will be used that are allocated in the FRIPRO project no. 239844 to organize a workshop in 2018. Budgeting for 40 participants, this means that we estimate a deficit of 55 KNOK and we hope that with help of 50 KNOK from IKTPLUSS we will be able to roughly break-even.",Universiteter,UoH-sektor,50000,Robert Jenssen,FAKULTET FOR NATURVITENSKAP OG TEKNOLOGI,Tromsø
283957,Deep Neural Networks for Energy Optimisation,2018,2022,"The focus artificial intelligence for energy related operations in technically advanced warehouses. The output of this PhD study will automate the energy related managements in a warehouse in order to reduce the operational cost and to improve the energy efficiency based on various data inputs and the-state-of-the-art deep neural network. 
A successful solution will be able to automatically (1) clean data inputs, (2) propose accurate forecast of future events and (3) suggest corresponding actions based on the deep neural network. The suggested actions will be deployed through different actuators in the system and the behavior of the system will become a feedback (input) to the neural network again.
Traditionally, this type of management is played by human being on experience basis and now we expect to adopt AI for such management. In the beginning, the suggested actions from AI may go through a small degree of manual inspections and the final goal is to reduce and eliminate the involvement of human being in the management.
Deep neural networks play a pivotal role in the system because the deep neural network will forecast future events and propose corresponding actions based on the inputs from various data sources. Depending on the configuration of the warehouses and the application of the system, the data inputs can include, for example, weather forecasts, expected operating conditions, energy storage along with data from a sensor network inside the warehouse. 

In this study, we consider primarily two areas: (1) improvement in energy efficiency and deduction in operating costs, and (2) optimization of thermal energy storage.

283999,Automatic FPI,2018,2021,"Fluorescent Penetrant Inspection (FPI) is a nondestructive test method which is very effective in detecting porosity, cracks, fractures, laps, seams and other flaws that are open to the surface of the test piece and may be caused by fatigue, impact, quenching, machining, grinding, forging, bursts, shrinkage or overload. FPI is currently used at GKN Aerospace Norway (GAN) on lots of machined parts, in particular for stator vanes, and involves a several stages process where the part is cleaned and then dipped in a fluorescent penetrant bath. Then, the penetrant is removed and a developer (dry powder) is sprayed for pulling the trapped penetrant material out of surface defects and spread it out on the surface of the part so it can be seen by an inspector. After the inspection, the part is cleaned.
Some of these operations have been partially automated during the years at GAN, and today the NDI workshop is equipped with a crane for loading parts and dipping them into the penetrant tubs; however, the last part of the process is still purely visual and relies on the skills of the operator.
Due to the very high number of vanes produced at GAN every week (some thousands), the human factor becomes significative in this process, since inspectors cannot ensure long-term consistency in their evaluations due to fatigue, needing breaks and rest periods to ensure high quality output which are required when inspecting jet engines parts. Besides that, inconsistency is also observed between the outputs of different inspectors. 
These factors highly contribute to increase the cost of the process and to undermine its reliability.
The project proposes to develop and test a vision-based system for automating the FPI process, including artificial intelligence based algorithms developed for training the automatic inspection system and confirm its evaluation by comparing them with the operators' output",Næringsliv,Næringsliv,2868089,Davide Caputo,GKN AEROSPACE NORWAY AS,Kongsberg
284008,NEW APPROACH OF PREDICTING MILK PRODUCTION RESPONSES AND FEED EFFICIENCY TO CHANGES IN DIET COMPOSITION TO BE USED IN NORFOR ONFARM SOFTWARE,2018,2021,"Feed represent one of the major costs in modern dairy production. The real feed value of the diet, the animal products, and the partial efficiency of feed utilization for the particular livestock product, all influence total efficiency, and thus overall feed costs. Continues development of our common Nordic feed evaluation system, NorFor, is an important step towards implementing more sophisticated nutritional strategies to control production responses from dairy cows and improve feed utilization. In a context of a higher volatility of feed and milk prices, quantification of animals multiple responses to dietary changes is of particular interest to help dairy farmers in optimizing the feeding and reducing the environmental impact. The main objective of this project is to improve the NorFor system by developing a dynamic dairy cow nutrition approach. This means moving from a diet formulation based on a pre-defined production level to a response approach, adjusting the diet based on the response to changes in diet composition. This should improve feed efficiency and improve financial return by a more precise feeding. Improved feed efficiency will also reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This new approach will be implemented to the NorFor software system. Farm variation has been one of the biggest challenges for adaprtation from R&D into the commercial area. Thus, a big challenge for this project is the intention to bring the ""Information and Communication Technologies"" (ICTs) into the Animal Science Field, like Machine Learning (ML). With ML, the goal is to bring the data collected from farms by sensing technologies (body changes, milk prodcution changes, etc.) for accounting farm variation. Other big Challenge is validation of the models. The Project will test the dynamic modelling approach on farms in Denmark, Norway and Sweden by implementing the models into national NorFor Client software Tools.",Næringsliv,Næringsliv,1652000,Tone Roalkvam,TINE Rådgiving,Ås

It is predicted to increase in coming years due to aging populations and thus constitutes an enormous socio-economic burden. Existing assessment strategies neglect the complex, multi-component, and heterogeneous pathophysiology, as well as manifold comorbidities (cardiovascular, metabolic etc.). Therefore, improved COPD diagnosis and classification constitutes an urgent medical need for improved and personalized prevention measures and treatments strategies. 
The main aim of our project is to develop a tool that will enable effective preventive measures and personalize treatment strategies for COPD by means of systems medicine. This transnational and interdisciplinary project combines clinical scientists, experimentalists, computational and systems biology researchers, as well as a medium sized company. We will develop a systems medicine model of COPD constructed on (i) machine learning clustering of two comprehensive patient cohorts (COSYCONET, CIRO) providing long-term clinical observations, systematic outcome evaluation, biomaterial collections, multiple laboratory measurements, and extensive imaging data of more than 6,000 patients, complemented by (ii) an iterative systems biology framework of modeling and experimental analysis. Based on this multi-scale systems medicine model, we will generate a novel Clinical Decision Support (CDS) software that we will evaluate for patient
care in the existing IT infrastructure of hospitals and private practices.

As a prototypic demonstrator of applied systems medicine modeling, our tool will enable
i) individual and comprehensive treatment and prevention measures for COPD patients
ii) significant reductions of socio-economic costs due to less mortality and disability
iii) novel insights in the dysregulation of metabolism, immunology and aging in COPD from the underlying model.",Universiteter,UoH-sektor,4000000,Nadav Skjøndal-Bar,Institutt for kjemisk prosessteknologi,Trondheim

The resulted product - Autonomous Computing as a Service (ACaaS) - will increase the employee satisfaction, by making easier identifying IT anomalies in Visma’s Data Centers, which is the prerequisite step in restoring IT services preemptively. By automatically identifying the misbehaviour of the systems supporting IT services, the System Administrators will be able to focus more on fixing these issues, rather than manually searching for potential causes. Knowing exactly what generated a fault, will also improve the average handling time of incident resolution, which will, as a result, increase the customers’ satisfaction.
The long term objective is to build a solution database, consisting in identified IT issues based on monitoring logs correlation, which coupled with the corresponding “fix” (i.e. script) will serve as a training data set for building a  Machine Learning model that will have the ultimate goal of creating self-healing IT services.

IoT systems envision a world with billions of objects having the capabilities for real-time data collection, processing and intelligent decision-making. In order to achieve its goal of providing intelligence based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms, IoT systems have relied on the computing resources provided by the cloud computing platforms, for processing the huge  volume of data, by transporting IoT data to the geographically distributed cloud data centers to support delay tolerant IoT services. The IoT based intelligence has leveraged the scalability, performance and global service accessibility capabilities of the cloud.

The FlexAqua project will address the key knowledge gaps related to the growing use of new shielding solutions, to prevent parasites infestation. These shielding technologies are of two types: parasites-barrier skirt and snorkel cages. The project will generate knowledge to prevent breakdown of these new farming systems which could lead to fish escapees.  Parameters like sea states (currents and waves) and effect of marine organisms will be investigated.
A novel Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI) analysis will be carry out on these flexible structures to predict hydrodynamic loading and structural behaviour under a range of sea states, which is of growing interest as aquaculture production extends to high-energy sites and so towards under severe environmental loading for structures. The effect of marine growth colonisation on the forces acting on these farming systems will be explored by using novel 3D imaging techniques and which will be used to develop more accurate and realistic FSI setups. New image processing techniques will
be developed for detecting and monitoring damages such as corrosion, cracks and net defects. Finally, an adapted sensors deployment strategy will be devised for cost efficient structural health monitoring of these complex flexible marine infrastructures.

Det er 420 millioner diabetikkere i verden, 90% har type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetestilstand kan forbedres og senskader kan forebygges ved å regulere livsstilfaktorer som overvekt, diett og fysisk aktivitet. Det er også svært viktig at pasienten får hjelp til å holde blodsukkeret stabilt over tid. 

Utfordringen er at 
1. Pasientene blir ikke informert veldig ofte etter diagnosen, hva det må endres og hvordan det skal endres?
2. Hva som må gjøres og til hvilken tidspunkt?
3- Nyttig informasjon er ikke lett tilgjengelig og kvaliteten på informasjonen er varierende. 

Nåværende behandlingsmetoder er standardisert, og er ikke tilpasset pasienten sykdomstatus og individuelle faktorer. I tillegg, savner pasienter et felleskap hvor likesinnede kan dele erfaring og få tips fra profesjonelle helsepersonell. 

Vi har en prosjekt-idé hvor vi skal bygge en digital løsning som gir en individuelt utviklet, fullt pesonalisert behandlingsplan for hver registrert bruker. Det bidrar til å forebygge forverring av diabetes tilstand og unngå senskader:

284491,MarTERA:Integrated Technologies Longterm Deployment of Robotic Underwater platforms,2018,2021,"A number of different tasks are nowadays already successfully performed with unmanned robotic platforms. Operations like ocean monitoring and exploration, bathymetric tasks or even inspection of underwater structures, are all good examples of tasks that be performed in an efficient and cost-effective way by AUVs. While the versatility of such platforms brings added benefits, its long term use is still very limited by the energetic autonomy of the vehicles. Therefore, deployment and recovery operations of the vehicle are always necessary, requiring non-negligible amounts of both time and personnel, but also of a support vessel. This leads to a significant impact in the operations costs.
Enabling long-term unattended operations, without the need of a support vessel, would dramatically decrease the cost of operating such vehicles, making them more affordable. Persistent and/or long-term deployment of AUVs, for exploration and monitoring tasks, has been foreseen as a future development. The main drive for this project arises from concrete and specific needs for long term monitoring of fish-farm infrastructures. In specific, the use of an AUV for those purposes would, on one side, allow the study of wild fish aggregations in such structures, and on the other allow a more continuous monitoring of the benthos under the fish farms.
The development of a new era of technologies that enable the aforementioned tasks are the core of this project, in particular for both contactless underwater power transmission and wireless communications. On top of that, the development of the navigation and control strategies that enable the vehicle to perform its inspection and monitoring activities will complement the key technological challenges of the project.",Universiteter,UoH-sektor,3355000,Lars Gansel,Institutt for biologiske fag Ålesund,Ålesund

The Signals2Solutions (S2S) platform is focused on analyzing non-stationary data and interpreting its results, based on a further deployment of the Hilbert-Huang Transform (HHT) methodology. Comparing with stationary signals (i.e. stable data along time), non-stationary signals (i.e. based on time-varying coefficients) generally better reflect real production cases, where the machines' use intensity varies according to different time schedules, productivity needs and working conditions. Therefore, HHT is the most indicated Predictive Maintenance method for those machinery and equipment characterized by high variability conditions, such as, for instance, drilling equipment and aircrafts & helicopters, where intensity use strongly vary based on e.g. the ground conditions or the aircraft condition. Until now the PM techniques used for those tasks have been basically two: Fourier Transform (FT) and Machine Learning (ML). Nevertheless, they both present evident limits when it comes to analyze equipment and machinery in real-use conditions, as they start from the assumption that signals by default are linear and stationary (FT) or that data generation mechanism of an equipment does not change over time (ML). On the other hand, Simulation & Lab tests of other signal analysis techniques based on HHT - i.e. Complete Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition with Adaptive Noise (CEEDMAN) and Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) - have shown that those techniques cannot be applied to Predictive Maintenance, as they currently require too much computing power and are therefore too low to effectively detect machinery problems.",Næringsliv,Næringsliv,50000,Geir Kulia,SIGNAL ANALYSIS LAB AS,Grimstad

Municipalities also experience that the total cost of the sensor solutions is much higher than expected due to communication and database needs. The iFLINK data infrastructure will be efficient, scalable, fast and open, potentially serving Norwegian municipalities as well as international clients based on modern capabilities of Big Data integration. iFLINK will fill-in the existing gap on providing real-time accurate air quality information with high spatial and temporal resolution at an affordable cost. The project will be piloted in five municipalities (Bergen, Bærum, Drammen, Kristiansand and Oslo). iFLINK will also allow public and private actors to develop real time environmental services related to e.g., air quality, climate change or noise, with a seamless interface to any local smart city development.
The anticipated result of our project is the successful connection of a variety of low-cost environmental sensors to an open technological platform that adds value to the sensor data by increasing their accuracy through applying machine learning and data assimilation algorithms. The platform will allow municipalities and other parties to access different data processing levels (i.e. from unprocessed sensor data to high resolution maps) according to their specific needs.",Øvrige offentlige,Øvrige,6999000,Nuria Castell,OSLO KOMMUNE BYMILJØETATEN,Oslo

Activities in the project will start in the third quarter of 2018 and end in the second quarter of 2019. The core team will gathering documentation and literature for research proposals, and organize the network collaboration, set up strategic meetings, and organize seminars and lectures. 
 We are planning to have a seminar in London in the fourth quarter of 2018, and a seminar in Bergen in the first quarter of 2019, where we will invite the partners of the TekLab Network. We want these seminars to foster two-way communication between younger and more experienced researchers. This means that in addition to lectures, we will have activities where ideas can be exchanged more easily, such as discussion groups and workshops. 
 The plan is to have a three-day seminar in London, in collaboration with Royal Holloway University, and a two-day seminar in Bergen, led by the University of Bergen and The Western Norway University of Applied Sciences. In Bergen, we would like to invite mainly Norwegian participants, but would also like to have a few international guests. We suggest Neil Maiden and Francesca Panetta as our keynote speakers. We will coordinate the seminar with master courses at UiB, HVO and HVL, and invite the students to attend selected sessions.
 Funding sources to be targeted. We have three main applications planned. These are: An application to the organization Free Project Support for the Humanities and Social Sciences (FRIHUMSAM), where the deadline is April 25th. The second is an application to The Council of Applied Media Research (RAM), where the deadline is October 1st. The final one is a second submission to NFR, for the suggested February 14th deadline in the first quarter of 2019. 
 The project will be wrapped up in the third quarter of 2019. Hopefully, TekLab will be able to secure further funds before the end of this period, in order to continue exploring our topics.",Universiteter,UoH-sektor,298000,Lars Nyre,Institutt for informasjons- og medievitenskap,Bergen
285528,Model based testing to support dynamic generation of complex test data,2018,2021,"Based on our current understanding of state of practice from our consultancy on software testing in the public sector, we have seen a tremendous need for better test data in order to support more systematic and complete software testing. Current many companies are using production data for testing purposes, however, this is problematic both because that this is illegal (according to EU regulations), and because that it does not support automated testing. 

Challenges:
Our hypothesis is that current tools and methods for model based test data generation have in large part developed on the basis of small toy examples and thus can not scale up to meet the practical need for software testing in large scale complex software systems. This hypothesis will be verified on the basis of our systematic review of the current state of the art, combined with our observatory case studies on both the current state of practice and actual needs identified in the public sector.
Our main challenge is thus to propose practical solutions to the very hard problem of generating sufficiently complex test data that will meed the actual requirements of our case study partners. Our solution approach is to iterative prototyping combined with cost benefit analysis of applying the prototypes on testing challenges faced by our case study partners.

Use of findings:
This aim of this project is to provide increased knowledge and prototype tools that can be further developed into industry strength tools that will help the industry and public sector to obtain sufficiently rich test data.",Næringsliv,Næringsliv,1556000,Erik Arisholm,TESTIFY AS,Nordre Follo
285531,Keenious - AI basert automatisk nettsøk verktøy for bruk under skriving av tekstdokumenter,2018,2019,"Hver dag skriver millioner av mennesker tekster og dokumenter digitalt. Mange av disse har høye krav til faglig innhold og mye kunnskap om det de skriver om. Dagens arbeidsmetodikker spriker, men det alle har til felles er at de benytter søkemotorer for å finne dokumenter på nettet, f.eks. forsknings- og nyhetsartikler, til bruk under skrivingen. Disse søkene krever at man har en konkret ide om hva man er på utkikk etter, og vet hvilke spesifikke søkeord og variasjoner av de som må brukes. På grunn av manglende forståelse av kontekst kan man allikevel få irrelevante søkeresultater eller unøyaktige resultater som man må manuelt jobbe seg gjennom. Disse problemene fører til at mange sløser bort tid på å finne fram til informasjonen, og dermed ikke får brukt tid på det som gjelder, den faktiske skrivingen.

Keenious gjør det mulig for deg å finne informasjon du har behov for direkte i ditt skriveprogram. Dette gjøres ved at programmet analysere teksten du skriver, og ved bruk av kunstig intelligens finner den lignende tekster og informasjon fra internett som det du skriver om. Informasjonen som programmet vurderer som relevant blir så presentert som anbefalinger rett inn i skriveprogrammet ditt, slik at du slipper å miste fokus ved å forlate tekstprogrammet. Dette gjøres kontinuerlig mens du skriver slik at forslagene alltid er relevant.

Keenious har kompetanse innen kunstig intelligens, avansert systemutvikling og entreprenørskap. Vi skal utvikle et kommersielt produkt som blir tilgjengelig for brukere av de største skriveprogrammene som Office Word og Google Docs i deres representative add-on stores. Markedsundersøkelsen som vi har utført viser til en stor interesse, spesielt fra studenter. Gjennom å selge tilgang til systemet til brukerne, ønsker vi å gjøre det mye lettere for studenter, journalister og andre som skriver tekster, å finne ressurser og kunnskap fra internett.",Næringsliv,Næringsliv,1000000,Frode Opdahl,KEENIOUS AS,Tromsø
285554,Investigating the impact of Artificial Intelligence on the Journalism's Social Contract - Issues of Machine Ethics in Modern Journalism,2018,2019,"The journalistic social contract is a metaphor used to describe the democratic role that the press plays in helping the citizens maintain oversight of the government, on one hand, and helping the government maintain transparency of its decisions to the citizens, on the other hand.  When the web content consumers became web content contributors as well the reciprocity principle in the journalist-citizen relationship has weakened. While some algorithmic affordances help citizens in performing their obligations in the contract, others limit them. Limitations, for example,  are due to   surveillance, terms of service contracts that induce `digital serfdom',  the emergence of `data shadows' etc.

The network specifically intends to explore  the current state of automation in news curation and the impact this automation has on the algorithmic social contract of journalism. 

The societal impact of automatisation in news curation is a problem that cannot be investigated from any one individual research discipline. This  impact  stems from the combination of artificial intelligence methods used, together with the inadequate legal framework that governs mass media in the digital age and further the moral ramifications on individual news consumers and society as a whole. To prevent the negative impact of automatisation here, one must first understand it and to do that an expertise is needed in  all of the disciplines involved. This project aims to secure that expertise.

The main two challenges in interdisciplinary collaboration are  to identify of the right experts and to enable communication between them. The project partners are all experts in the relevant disciplines and can thus identify the important people that the network must engage.  The proposed workshop  aims to bring the stakeholders  up to speed with the language and state-off the art of the relevant aspects of the disciplines not their own, by inviting overview tutorials from different experts.",Universiteter,UoH-sektor,297000,Marija Slavkovik,DET SAMFUNNSVITENSKAPELIGE FAKULTET,Bergen

Shipping is and will be one of the leading Norwegian industries. This project develops innovative solutions for networks of sensors, programmed to measure many variables which are known to be important in describing the status of various types of machineries and components of a vessel. ABB has unique access to such sensor data, which are for the first time streamed from vessels in operation to ABB?s control centre in Norway. The purpose of the thesis is to investigate how these data can be used to generate deep knowledge about processes and dynamics, which lead to abnormal operations or even faults on vessels. 
This thesis focuses on two challeges: (i) Data management of huge data time series of different scale, collected over longer periods and on many vessels: how to organise, match and annotate such data in order to be able to investigate patterns and perform analysis? (ii) High dimensional, scalable statistical methods are needed, together with efficient machine learning approaches, in order to detect abnormalities or faults appearing in some components and in some scales, as rapidly as possible. 
The time series are high dimensional, with hundreds of sensors on each vessel and the signal of abnormality can reside in any of the stochastic multivariate structures of the time series. In addition, multivariate dependence can be at various lags. The series need to be analysed for surprising and abnormal behaviour.
The sample frequency of the sensors varies very much. We will study how to handle these variable sample frequencies without resorting on massive missing values, both in storing and in analysing. 
Real time sensor data lead to huge data sets, which challenge storage and algorithms. All our methods and algorithms must scale computationally.",Næringsliv,Næringsliv,1697000,Morten Stakkeland,ABB AS,Bærum

Valuable work has recently been done to advance efficiency and quality of EPC work by developing powerful semantic representations allowing reasoning over, and verification of large requirement structures.

Our idea is to extend the work above to the operations phase of the asset lifecycle, i.e. the phase where the asset goes “live” to explore, drill for, or produce hydrocarbon resources. We believe that EPC requirements (probably in a reduced and adapted version) can follow the asset into operations and become the knowledge base of an online compliance management solution that tracks asset behaviour through sensor readings, warns when the operational state moves into non-compliant status, and assists (or automates) the restoration of a compliant operation.",Næringsliv,Næringsliv,1667000,Thomas Bech Pettersen,COMPUTAS AS,Oslo

This allows cost-effective and efficient interfacing with emulated hardware and software output, and the possibility to run simulations faster than perceived human real time and gives the possibility to train various controlled weather and wave conditions. The benchmark will be the simulated ship itself, hereby providing a 100% guarantee that the algorithm is fit for purpose.
 
Model environment and emulate sensors: wave, wind and current based on sensor data. Create or improve realistic sensor data from simulator: wind sensor, Radar, Lidar, Wave Radar, MRUs, wave buoys, Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler, thruster command and actual output, crane cargo specific sensor, Ballast information, model various cargo and ballast loads and ballast loads, as well as mooring forces in a simulator. Focus here is to model exact current, wind, and wave environment, which is key to precisely predict ship motions, possible applications are on-board real-time augmented tools like energy optimization tools, and collision prevention and other prediction systems. Parallel to sensing and modelling environment and ships, a standard method for testing digital ship models in virtual sea trials has to be agreed upon, both theoretical and programmatically.
Once the environment and benchmarking are in place, data-driven machine learning algorithms can be developed and tested in a fast and effective manner (third step). For this purpose, develop an API to interface with simulation framework for algorithms to learn, analyse and predict the simulated ship motions, hereby making a data-driven ship model. When algorithms are stable enough and trustable against the benchmark, the next step is to switch from the realistic simulated data to the offline and online real data (step 4).",Næringsliv,Næringsliv,1667000,Joel Alexander Mills,OFFSHORE SIMULATOR CENTRE AS,Ålesund

286558,Hybrid Deep Learning Cellular Automata Reservoir,2020,2023,"The ambitious research goal of the DeepCA project is to create a theoretical and experimental foundation for a novel hybrid deep learning paradigm based on cellular automata and biological neural networks, in order to bridge the gap between neuroscience and deep learning towards self-learning devices that are significantly more efficient than the state-of-the-art. The desired results have the potential for breakthroughs in novel substrates for machine learning (easily transferrable to hardware implementations), as well as direct medical applications. 

Current deep learning implementations are not easily transferrable to hardware devices for widespread adoption, e.g., to sensor devices and Internet of Things, due to the required computing power and complexity of the underlying architectures. Therefore, a different computing paradigm is needed. Investigating biological neural cultures information processing and dynamics could lead to better, more powerful, energy efficient implementations of deep learning systems.

The main hypothesis in DeepCA is that deep architectures of cellular automata reservoir can significantly facilitate the implementation of recurrent neural networks and reservoir dynamics, in order to efficiently interface biological neural networks and implement learning through local interactions.

DeepCA combines Norway's leading experts in cellular automata and unconventional computing at OsloMet and neuroscience/neuro-computation at NTNU, with internationally leading researchers in morphogenetic engineering at Manchester Metropolitan University and hyperdimensional computing at Luleå University of Technology, forming together a very strong multidisciplinary team to complete DeepCA's ambitious research tasks.

Konsekvensen kan bli flere biler på veien og større utfordringer med trafikkavviklingen enn i dag.

Autonome biler kan redusere behovet for parkeringsplasser i byer, samtidig kan kjøretøyene bli sendt ut i trafikken uten sjåfør fordi parkeringsplassene er for dyre, eller man ikke fant noen. Dette vil generere mer trafikk og dårlig fremkommelighet. Autonome kjøretøy kan også bli stående fast med tekniske feil, eller manglende evne for å komme seg løs fra en trafikksituasjon.

Entreprenører vil kanskje få enda mer å gjøre for å sikre fremkommeligheten på veien. Veimyndighetene vil kanskje få økte krav for å overvåke og kontrollere at veien har god fremkommelighet. For å sikre god fremkommelighet må de kanskje bruke mer ressurser til brøyting, strøing, salting og vedlikehold av veiene. Hvordan skal veiene instrumenteres i forhold til å sikre god fremkommelighet, sikker trafikkavvikling og trygge opplevelser for alle trafikanter.

Our physics goal is to elucidate how energy and momentum are transferred among microscopic matter constituents in extreme conditions, where ""extreme"" may refer to high temperatures or density. It requires us to compute the transport coefficients bulk and shear viscosity. In quantum field theory, such real-time properties are encoded in spectral functions. Extracting those from standard first-principles Monte-Carlo simulations however amounts to an exponentially hard inverse problem. We aim to overcome this issue with an improved extraction (subproject I) and an alternative simulation prescription (subproject II).

In subproject I a PhD student will apply the concept of autoencoder (AE), a pillar of the deep-learning revolution in image processing, to the extraction of spectral functions from Monte-Carlo simulations. The central task is to develop the required topology and training strategy for the neural network. A large data pool from previous work of the PI will be an essential training ingredient. The ability of an AE to represent relevant features of input in hidden layers will be used to obtain improved Bayesian regularization schemes for inverse problems.

In subproject II a postdoc will combine deep learning with complex Langevin simulations to compute real-time properties directly, evading the inverse problem. The Langevin approach so far has suffered from instabilities, which we propose to overcome by a neural network that acts as a dynamical control system. Developing and training the network in both the non-interacting theory, where analytic data is available and from concurrent standard imaginary time simulations will be the central challenge.

This will enable musicologists to acquire a systematic and explicit understanding of music in a much deeper level than using traditional methods or previous state of the art in computational musicology. 
The scientific ambitions of MIRAGE is not solely related to the conception of AI and signal processing algorithms able to perform advanced operations of interest for musicology. It is also to establish a detailed and explicit answer to theoretical musicological problems, related to the formalization of music analysis.
The rich description of music will also foster the enrichment of cognitive models predicting listeners’ percepts and reactions to music, for instance for the study of emotion in music.
Moreover, music cognition needs to be understood as a complex system composed of highly interdependent modules. A computational system built on a set of general heuristics that is able to mimic music cognition on a large range of music would offer a valuable blueprint for the establishment of cognitive models.
The software technologies developed in the project will also have a wider transformational impact on how tomorrow’s technologies will be used to understand and appreciate music. We will also apply these technologies for music therapy.

287465,What makes a tree a tree? Characterization and evolution of the gene regulatory network underlying wood development,2019,2024,"Everything that we make from oil could also be made from wood. However, despite the vital importance and vast potential of forests, we still cannot answer the most fundamental question: What makes a tree a tree? Nevertheless, comparative genomics have in recent years dramatically increased our understanding of the evolutionary history and architecture of plant genomes, and revealed a remarkable difference in genome size and composition.  From these studies we know that gene content varies comparatively little – even between trees and non-tree species – and changes in gene regulation have now emerged as the primary explanation for the evolution of woody plants.

In this project, we aim to model the regulatory networks orchestrating the differentiation of stem cells into woody tissues in order to understand the wood formation process in several angiosperms and gymnosperms – the two tree-containing plant lineages separated by over 200 million years of evolution. We will compare regulatory networks to identify specific regulatory mechanisms that separate the two tree lineages from each other and trees from non-tree plants, and we will experimentally test some of the most interesting findings. Modeling approaches such as machine learning are often hampered by the vast number of interacting genes giving rise to complex biological systems. Here we will generate extensive data set on gene regulation and integrate these with prior knowledge in order to infer and align networks across species. This will require highly interdisciplinary research including the development of new computational frameworks and the application of advanced molecular profiling techniques in non-model organisms.

287745,Morphosyntactic Production in Stroke-induced Agrammatic Aphasia: A Cross-linguistic Machine Learning Approach,2019,2023,"The aim of the proposed project is to improve state-of-the-art knowledge on aphasia, focusing on verb-related (morpho)syntactic production. This deficit is considered to be the hallmark of agrammatic aphasia, which usually occurs following damage to Broca’s area and neighbouring areas in the left hemisphere. Although many studies on (morpho)syntactic production in agrammatic aphasia have been conducted thus far, little is known on the factors that determine the relative preservation or impairment of a given verb-related morphosyntactic category (e.g., Tense, subject-verb Agreement, grammatical Mood) in a given person with agrammatic aphasia (PWAA) in a given language. Inspired by the developments in machine learning, the proposed project aims at filling this gap by taking an original and innovative methodological approach. Machine Learning Aphasia addresses two important, yet unanswered questions: (1) Which factors determine the performance accuracy of a given PWAA, native speaker of a given language, on verb-related morphosyntactic production? (2) What is the hierarchy of factors/predictors of successful verb-related morphosyntactic production in agrammatic aphasia? 

Addressing questions 1 and 2 will advance our understanding of the complexities underlying morphosyntactic production in agrammatic aphasia, which will be a significant contribution to cognitive science (in particular to psycholinguistics, neurolinguistics, theoretical linguistics, and cognitive neuropsychology). Importantly, achieving goals 1 and 2 will also have significant clinical implications, as the findings about the best predictors of morphosyntactic production in agrammatic aphasia will inform and improve treatment programmes for PWAA. For instance, if the proposed study finds that verbal working memory capacity is one of the best predictors of performance on (morpho)syntactic production, treatment programmes should also include cognitive training targeting verbal working memory.",Universiteter,UoH-sektor,9993000,Valantis Fyndanis,Center for Multilingualism in Society Across the Lifespan (MultiLing),Oslo
287893,AI-DRIVEN TESTING OF FALSE DATA INJECTION ATTACKS AGAINST TRANSPORT INFRASTRUCTURES,2019,2022,"In transport infrastructures, vessel traffic services, air-traffic management and connected cars all rely on unauthenticated and unencrypted messages transfer that renders these services vulnerable to cyberattacks. Typical attacks such as False Data Injection Attacks (FDIA) are difficult to detect as they alter the semantics of the data (e.g., by adding/removing/multiplying elements on a real-time control equipment), while preserving the syntactical correctness of the messages. Identifying these attacks and classifying them as serious threats or unintentional false data has become a major challenge of traffic monitoring authorities. The TSAR project aims at demonstrating that recent advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be leveraged in the automatic detection of FDIA in transport infrastructures. By combining realistic threat data generation based on constraint-based software testing techniques and automatic detection with deep reinforcement learning, TSAR will propose a new technology for automatic FDIA generation and detection. This technology will be empirically evaluated with end-users from the maritime domain and with open and accessible data in two other domains, namely air traffic control and connected cars. By leveraging automatic detection of FDIA in traffic management systems, TSAR will also prepare the ground for the upcoming revolution in traffic management which concerns, self-driving vessels, self-driving aircrafts and self-driving cars.",Øvrige forskningsinstitutter,Instituttsektor,9995000,Dusica Marijan,SIMULA RESEARCH LABORATORY AS,Bærum

287979,Additively manufactured magnetic high entropy alloys for renewable electricity,2019,2023,"Conversion between movement and electricity has become a critical part of the global renewable energy system, with wind mills and electric vehicles as prominent examples. Soft magnetic materials are in the heart of electromagnetic generators and electric motors, but there is still much to desire from their functional and mechanical properties. Non-ideal magnetic properties may lead to fatigue and loss of generation efficiency or even mechanical failure. The present project aims to introduce a new generation of materials for soft magnets: high entropy alloys (HEA) generated with additive manufacturing (AM). HEA have demonstrated surprising combinations of properties in various fields, and a few recent works have indicated that this may also be the case for soft magnetic materials. Furthermore, the rich compositional freedom in these materials implies huge possibilities of tailoring functional and mechanical properties to specific applications. The goal of Magnificent is to identify novel HEA-based soft magnets with superior magnetic properties that exhibit significantly reduced losses and fatigue compared to the current state-of-the-art. At the same time, processing by AM facilitates net shape construction of complex geometries and potentially low-emission, distributed production. The project constitutes a complete suite of synthesis and characterization tools, facilitating screening of a large number of potential candidate materials in the search of optimal compositions. In addition, modelling efforts will contribute to the screening by suggesting new materials as well as rationalizing experimental results. But first and foremost, the project partners have endorsed the principles of responsible research and innovation, with specific actions on health, environment, and safety, proactive ethical principles, and a comprehensive risk assessment.",Teknisk-industrielle institutter,Instituttsektor,9970000,Spyros Diplas,Bærekraftig energiteknologi,Trondheim

Marine litter are also present and increasing in the Arctic. While some mapping and characterization has been done, major gaps of knowledge to understand where the litter is distributed throughout the Norwegian, Barents, Kara Seas and the high Arctic and what its characteristics and sources are remain unexplored. In this project, the main objective is to map areas of marine litter and describe its characteristics in the Arctic in collaboration with Russian institutions with a multi-disciplinary approach. We will extract data from the scientific & grey literature on the distribution of litter in the Norwegian Russian Arctic, identify ongoing activities on this topic both in Norway and Russia, build up a joint Norwegian Russian database, perform mapping using multidisciplinary approaches (robotics, digital solutions, GIS, satellite pictures), Collect offshore data using research cruises of opportunity, develop a predictive tool for litter distribution, and, importantly disseminate the findings to the students, public and policy makers both nationally in Norway and Russia and also internationally (EU, UNEP, Arctic Council). Through such a project, we believe that thorough science along with professional communication to kids, education of students and delivering high quality information to policy makers, the enthusiasm for plastic may come back up again!",Øvrige forskningsinstitutter,Instituttsektor,5000000,Lionel Camus,AKVAPLAN NIVA AS,Tromsø

288285,Vulnerability in the Robot Society (VIROS),2019,2023,"The increasing deployment of robots and artificial intelligence (AI) systems is introducing new layers of critical infrastructures in various areas of our society. This contributes to new digital vulnerabilities and poses novel legal and regulatory questions. The VIROS project investigates the challenges and solutions in regulating robotics and AI technologies – legally and technically – particularly with respect to addressing the safety, security and privacy concerns such systems raise. It addresses these issues along two main prongs of research: (i) smart robots, privacy, security and safety; and (2) healthcare robots. The first prong analyses the legal and technical challenges in addressing privacy, security and safety concerns that smart robots pose. The second prong examines the legal, technical and ethical issues associated with the growing inter-dependence and interactions of tangible and virtual elements in robots used for healthcare purposes.

The project will run for five years. It will be undertaken by an interdisciplinary team comprising researchers from the Robotics and Intelligent Systems (ROBIN) research group at the Department of Informatics, UiO, together with researchers at the Norwegian Research Center for Computers and Law (NRCCL) and other departments at the Law Faculty, UiO. The bulk of research will be carried out by four research fellows at doctoral and post-doctoral level. Two will be based at the NRCCL and will work on the legal and regulatory aspects of the two research prongs.

288396,Stability under Adversarial INfluence of Transmission Grids,2019,2023,"Securing cyber-physical systems (CPS) is critical not only for ensuring the correct and reliable functioning of both the CPS and its environment, but is also required to prevent physical, bodily, or environmental harm.  One critical aspect for any CPS, whether at small scale such as in local Internet of Things or for critical infrastructures such as power networks is the problem of observability. Not only is full observability difficult to achieve and often cost-prohibitive, but measurements or even sensors may be subverted. This can lead to malicious influence on control decisions or denial of controllability as well as indirectly to suboptimal decision support and machine learning by adversarial learning.
The problems in obtaining secure state estimates for power systems can hence be considered a particularly challenging case as these are inherently distributed, hard real-time systems that impose stringent requirements on any algorithmic approaches to security and robustness. The proposed research seeks to study a family of state estimation algorithms and their security motivated by new developments in power systems anticipated for the coming decades, namely heavier reliance on phasor measurement units (PMUs) and the increased importance of HVDC interconnections. For the latter, the accuracy and trustworthiness of measurements at such points is disproportionately important to the correct attainment of state estimates and subsequent decisions, and has not been studied thus far, nor has the security of hybrid AC-HVDC models. 
We therefore wish to study the robustness and stability of constrained state estimators to faults and attacks, emphasising malicious state forcing and convergence-prevention attacks.
The primary contributions of the proposed work are the identification of critical measurements and topology information for deliberate attacks against hybrid state estimators together with rapid detection and mitigation mechanisms.",Universiteter,UoH-sektor,9602000,Stephen Wolthusen,Institutt for informasjonssikkerhet og kommunikasjonsteknologi,Gjøvik
288727,Artificial intelligence - a novel tool in assisted reproduction technology,2019,2023,"The fertility rates have declined in many industrialized countries during the last decades. This can partly be explained by socioeconomical factors, but may also be due to biologically related matters. Around 15% of couples will encounter fertility problems. Over the last decades, there has been a development of assisted reproduction technology (ART), and the use of ART treatment is increasing. The method of intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) was originally a treatment for couples where the male has reduced semen quality, but is often used also when the semen characteristics are normal. 

ART is to a high degree based on subjective assessments of spermatozoa and embryos, utilizing only a limited set of information. This project aims to develop strategies for making the selection of embryo and spermatozoa based on more objective criteria. AI methods make it possible to analyse large amounts of data from imaging and cell biological examinations to uncover patterns applicable in developing new methods for assessments of spermatozoa and embryos. By relating these patterns to ART outcome, the assessments will be optimized to improve the treatment results. This project also aims to develop tools for clinicians and embryologist to make more evidence-based decisions and thereby improving the ART outcome.

AI methods constitute a new approach compared with traditional statistical methods, which are not equipped to reveal nonlinearities and complex relations between factors. A challenge using AI models is that they are more complex to interpret than traditional statistical models. Although the models may fit better to the data, it may be challenging to make them generalizable. Furthermore, the analysis may be difficult to understand by the users, but we will comply with this through a unique support system.

Potential impact of the project findings is to reduce the number of treatment cycles and to lower cost per treatment.",Universiteter,UoH-sektor,10000000,Trine Berit Haugen,Institutt for naturvitenskapelige helsefag,Oslo
288787,Reducing Digital Vulnerabilities by Providing Software Engineers with Intelligent Automated Software Security Assessment Technology,2019,2024,"Software has become a central part of nearly all sectors of economic activity, and our daily lives have become increasingly dependent on complex software-intensive systems, i.e., systems in which software interacts with other software, other systems, devices, sensors and with people. Exploitation of vulnerabilities in software can affect thousands or even millions of people and lead to massive damages.

The secureIT project will help reduce software vulnerabilities by addressing the problem at its source: We will develop advanced methods and techniques that help software engineers predict the vulnerability of source code during development, well before it can be exploited.

The overall goal of this project is to significantly reduce digital vulnerability of ICT by devising intelligent automated software security assessment technology that supports software engineers by systematically and continuously predicting the vulnerability of source code in the development stage.

We reach this goal using three scientific break-throughs that will advance the state of the art in software security assessments:
(1) Vulnerability Prediction based on Vulnerability Smells and Security Anti-Patterns
(2) Anomaly-based Vulnerability Prediction
(3) Improving Vulnerability Predictions using Historical Data

Timeliness: The secureIT project builds on the PI's earlier achievements in automated software inspection, code smell detection, cross-language information flow analysis in heterogeneous systems, and frequent pattern mining and anomaly detection in high-volume data. Recent advances in machine learning together with the PI's new results on automatically learning patterns in high volume data and generalizing them using rule aggregation [27 in project description] make that now is the best time to start this research. Software vulnerability needs to be reduced, and the global state-of-the-art was not at the required level to start this ambitious research undertaking until just recently.",Øvrige forskningsinstitutter,Instituttsektor,24018000,Leon Moonen,SIMULA RESEARCH LABORATORY AS,Bærum
289518,Combining spectral and image information in the analysis of hyperspectral imaging data,2019,2022,"Infrared microspectroscopic imaging is a new technique for rapid, label-free and automated diagnosis of various types of cancer. The technique is expected to enter clinical routine analysis in the years coming. The information content in infrared microspectroscopic image data is overwhelming. An infrared microspectroscopic image typically consists of several thousands to several hundred thousands of pixels, with a full infrared spectrum with several thousand frequency readings in every pixel. Today, only chemical information extracted from the spectral domain is used for classification of tissues into healthy tissue and different cancer types. While morphological information is utilized in medical image analysis of histological images without a spectral domain, the morphological information in the analysis of infrared microspectroscopic images is ignored. DeepHyperSpec will combine deep learning methods with multivariate modelling of scattering and absorption in biomedical vibrational spectroscopy in order to develop a new paradigm for the analysis of hyperspectral imaging data.  The acquired knowledge and methodology will allow to fully exploit the spectral and the image domain in hyperspectral imaging data and thus substantially increase the precision, interpretability and stability of classification models. The results of DeepHyperSpec will have an impact on other fields employing hyperspectral imaging, such as geospatial hyperspectral imaging and monitoring by satellites and drones.

Videre vil vi også utarbeide et forslag til systemarkitektur for systemet som kan implementeres. Selv om vi utvikler løsningen for TT ser vi også muligheten for å benytte systemet for å løse andre “transport” oppgaver, som flåtestyring rundt store byggeplasser.

Kostnader og finansiering for et tiltenkt hovedprosjekt
I forprosjektet vil vi beregne kostnadene for neste fase av realiseringen. Hovedsakelig vil dette bli rundt implementasjon, vedlikehold og drift av denne løsningen for Oslo og Akershus Fylkeskommune.",Næringsliv,Næringsliv,225200,Mark Alan West,BOUVET NORGE AS,Oslo
290386,Machine learning algorithms for operational ship detection in synthetic aperture radar images,2018,2020,"The project will develop new and improved algorithms for operational inference of information about the presence and properties of sea vessels based on deep learning in SAR images. Ship detection is the main focus of the project, but extraction of higher-level information, such as ship type, size and heading, is a natural next task. The work will both target existing satellites and prepare for upcoming missions with innovative SAR modes. A subtask is to find strategies for efficient adaptation of developed algorithms to new sensors and SAR modes. This can be done by transfer learning, which includes judicious reuse of certain parts of the deep architectures, while modifying and retraining other parts. Deep learning methods can efficiently exploit contextual information to identify the characteristics of vessels that extend over multiple pixels and reject the typical spatial patterns of range and azimuth ambiguities. Another motivating property is their ability to learn features implicitly from training data, thus avoiding explicit feature extraction and encoding of prior knowledge. Operational ship detection introduces challenges that can be efficiently dealt with by deep learning from example data, including rejection of ambiguities and target look-alikes. The literature holds some examples of successful application of deep learning to ship detection, but much work is still needed to transfer research into an operational systems and obtain the performance required in an environment governed by customer specifications and near real-time constraints, concerning processing speed, detection performance, reliability and robustness. The validation process will utilize the operational processing environment at KSAT with access to large amounts of training data. The project will profit on unique access to multimission SAR data, ground truth data from the Automatic Identification System network, and knowledge about user requirements.",Ukjent,Annet,543000,Tony Bauna,Ingen,NA

The PhD will be taken at NTNU, Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering.

The PhD project is a part of a collaboration between NTNU and Laerdal that has been going on for a few years. NTNU will use case examples and tasks from Laerdal R&D challenges in their teaching, including yearly master thesis.

The main R&D challenges around human patient simulation is creating realistic interaction between the simulator and the users. The challenges are on interactions such as speech, movement, vision, touch and feel in addition to clinical signs such as ECG, skin color, breathing patterns, sounds etc.

By placing a PhD candidate at NTNU, Laerdal will strengthen the scientific competence of the Laerdal company, not only for the PhD candidate but also for other members of the product development function. The project will strengthen Laerdal's R&D competence and capabilities, exploring technologies that can be used for developing patient simulators.

The PhD study will be centered around sensors, actuators, materials and mechanical solutions used for simulation of human body functions, in a patient simulation context. This can be movement of limbs, simulation of human skin reactions such as rashes, simulation of chest movement, injections of needles and fluid responses.
In addition, the PhD will have a product development methodology dimension.

Examples R&D challenges explored through the current cooperation between NTNU TrollLABS and Laerdal are moving and responding eyes (Master Thesis 2017), realistic ultrasound guided injection site of REBOA, realistic chest concerning force and response of CPR manikin (Master Thesis 2018).

Universitetet har i sin stategiske plan uttrykt et ønske om å styrke sitt internasjonale samarbeid. Det første av totalt to hovedmål for dette  prosjektet er derfor å etablere et forskningssamarbeid mellom University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) og USN. UCLA er et internasjonalt anerkjent universitet, og tiltrekker seg forskere og aktører fra næringslivet både nasjonalt og internasjonalt. 

Videre har fakultetet TNM ved USN et av sine hovedsatsingsområder innen maskinlæring og automatisering. Kompetanseløft innen maskinlæring er derfor det andre hovedmålet for dette prosjektet. 
UCLA har våren 2019 satt opp maskinlæring som et tematisk forskningsområde med et program som går over 2 måneder. Programmet består av totalt 5 workshoper og omfavner interessenter både fra akedemia og næringslivet. 

Fakultetet TNM ved USN har et etablert forskingsmiljø, med forankring i lokalt næringsliv. I flere av de sentrale forskingsaktivitetene vi nå er involvert i, er vår antagelse at Maskin Læring vil være en egnet løsningsstrategi. Det vil derfor fra fakultetes side være av stor interesse at forskere tilegner seg økt kompetanse innen Maskin Læring. Gjennom et samarbeid med maskinlæringsmiljøet ved UCLA vil vi tilegne oss kunnskap for oppgaver vi ikke klarer å løse lokalt i dag.

Abnormal lung sounds are among symptoms of these diseases, which are detected during a quick physical examination with a stethoscope. However, detection and interpretation of auscultation findings is subjective and manual, research has shown that clinicians interpret lung sounds differently. This makes the auscultation results unreliable and communication between health professionals more challenging. There have been developed digital stethoscopes, that allow sound recording, but currently there exist no solutions for automatic and objective detection of lung sounds.
Medsensio is developing a cloud- and subscription-based platform for automatic detection and classification of normal/abnormal lung sounds, using deep learning, with an exclusive license to access worlds biggest dataset of annotated lung sounds.
The first product - training tool for learning lung sounds- built on this platform, is now market-ready. During conducted beta tests it received positive feedback and obtained affirmative results from analyzing its intended use. Medsensio has also received interest for the lung sound analysis platform from clinical perspective and believes that the platform has greater user value, commercial potential and societal impact as a clinical tool.
We want to assess how feasible it is to build such application with all necessary regulatory approvals, using our platforms algorithms, and evaluate its market potential for developing a sustainable business model. Such feasibility study fully corresponds to the application description for EU project under SME instrument phase 1.

291171,Personalised preventive diabetes care solution,2018,2019,"Bakgrunn:

Diabetes er blitt en av de største helseutfordringer for hele verden. Diabetes behandling koster verdens samfunnet rundt $438 millarder årlig*. Det er 420 millioner diabetikkere i verden, 90% har type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetestilstand kan forbedres og senskader kan forebygges ved å regulere livsstilfaktorer som overvekt, diett og fysisk aktivitet. Det er også svært viktig at pasienten får hjelp til å holde blodsukkeret stabilt over tid. 

Utfordringen er at 
1. Pasientene blir ikke informert veldig ofte etter diagnosen, hva det må endres og hvordan det skal endres?
2. Hva som må gjøres og til hvilken tidspunkt?
3- Nyttig informasjon er ikke lett tilgjengelig og kvaliteten på informasjonen er varierende. 

Nåværende behandlingsmetoder er standardisert, og er ikke tilpasset pasienten sykdomstatus og individuelle faktorer. I tillegg, savner pasienter et felleskap hvor likesinnede kan dele erfaring og få tips fra profesjonelle helsepersonell. 

Vi har en prosjekt-idé hvor vi skal bygge en digital løsning som gir en individuelt utviklet, fullt pesonalisert behandlingsplan for hver registrert bruker. Det bidrar til å forebygge forverring av diabetes tilstand og unngå senskader: 
        1- Skreddersyr forslag basert på pasientens sykdomstilstand og individuelle faktorer.
        2- Hovedsakelig er fokus på ernæring og fysiske aktiviteter.
        3- Gir motivasjon til pasienten slik at vedkommende følger legens instrukser og er bedre på self-kontroll.
Ved bruk av IoT-enheter for kontinuerlig å følge pasientens tilstand og status (smart vekt for å måle BMI, kroppsfett, muskelmasse, smart klokker for aktivitetssporing og smart blodsukkermåler),

Ved bruk av AI for å velge ut den riktige behandlingsmetoder og riktige doseringer av medisiner basert på pasientens fysiske og sykdoms tilstand. Ved bruk av dyp læring for å kontinuerlig utvikle metodene basert på oppsamlede data fra alle pasientene.

«I nesten alle henvendelser finner ombudene elementer av mangelfull eller dårlig informasjon. God og hensiktsmessig kommunikasjon mellom helsepersonell og de som mottar tjenestene, inkludert deres pårørende, er avgjørende for pasientsikkerheten.»

Bakgrunn for prosjektet
Antall henvendelser til AMK-sentralene var 929 178 i 2016. Sentralene har ansvaret for å håndtere primærressurser tilsvarende ca NOK 13 mrd (beløpet inkluderer kun ambulanse- og luftambulansetjenester). 

En forbedring/effektivisering på kun 1% utgjør hele NOK 130 millioner.

Basis for den medisinske beslutningsprosessen i AMK er nedfelt i 38 algoritmer i «Norsk indeks for medisinsk nødhjelp» (NMI). En nylig avlagt doktorgrad tyder på at det er varierende grad av etterlevelse av NMI (Ellensen et al.,2014). For krisekommunikasjonen -altså selve samtalemetodene med innringer, er det foreløpig ikke nedfelt noen algoritmer for AMK. 

Det finnes ingen standardisert rekruttering, utdanning eller etterutdanning for AMK-operatører. Ferdighetsnivået til operatørene er  ikke basert på systematisk opplæring i psykologiske virkemidler i krisekommunikasjon. 

Prosjektet  skal bygge første trinn i denne standardiseringen, basert på metoder fra medisinsk kommunikasjonsforskning og påvirkningspsykologi. Det vil bli  bygget en kopi av en AMK-sentral og første modul av et standardisert treningsprogram for kommunikasjon med innringer. Fokuset på helseeffekter er avgjørende, for eksempel tid fra innringing til start HRL. Alt dette i et full-elektronisk grensesnitt. 

Ferdighetstreningen vi utvikler bygger på to fundamentale datakilder:
 1) Empirisk forskning innenfor helsepersonell-pasient-kommunikasjon. 

2) Lydloggene gjør det klart hva som går galt og når. 
For et trenet øre dokumenterer de imidlertid også mangel på presisjon og verdiskaping også når det ikke går galt, men hvor det kunne gått bedre.",Næringsliv,Næringsliv,75000,Arne Hansson Rannestad,HEADROOM LIFE SCIENCE AS,Stavanger
292798,"Data-driven Algorithms for Physical Simulations -
with applications to breast cancer growth modelling and treatment optimisation",2018,2019,"Modern applications in computational science, such as in biomedicine and climate science, are governed by multi-scale and partially unknown physically processes, and hence are numerically challenging to solve. The plummeting cost of sensors, computational power, and data storage in the last decade offers new opportunities for data-driven modelling of such physical systems. However, while both physical modelling and purely data-driven methods are active independent research areas, surprisingly little attention has been paid to the intersection of the two. In order to enable a shift towards simulation models that are either parametrised or controlled by data-driven algorithms, there is a pressing need
for new mathematical tools, new numerical abstractions and new algorithms. The ambition of DataSim is therefore to develop efficient algorithms to enable data-driven simulation described by partial differential equations. Specifically, we will propose simulation models that consist of coupled partial differential equations and machine learning models, and develop a high-level software framework for specifying, evaluating and training such models. Based on this approach, we
will investigate new algorithms for model identification and adaptive control methods for partially unknown and dynamically changing physical systems. The capabilities of the new algorithms will be demonstrated by identifying cell growth models for breast cancer tumours and by optimising treatment therapies. 

The outcomes of DataSim could have a transformative scientific impact for complex physical simulations and control problems in computational science, and societal impact through the development of
improved breast cancer models and treatment strategies.",Øvrige forskningsinstitutter,Instituttsektor,272000,Simon Funke,SIMULA RESEARCH LABORATORY AS,Bærum
294330,"Statistical and machine learning methods for recommender systems in a complex, high dimensional, online marketplace.",2018,2021,"This project is concerned with developing novel statistical and machine learning methodologies  in the area of recommendation systems: matching relevant content (items) to users in an online marketplace, where there is a large number of items and the information about each item and user is very limited.

Marketplaces are platforms where users buy and sell various types of items. The items can range from low-value ones such as books and clothes to high-value ones such as cars and real estate properties. Sellers can also post non-tangible items such as job openings and services. Many marketplace sellers are non-professional individuals selling used items, therefore marketplaces can be viewed as a special type of e-commerce that involves a very large number of unique items across multiple categories from a very large and fragmented seller group.

This thesis will develop new statistical and machine learning methods to solve some of the important open problems for recommender system in marketplaces, building models, inferential and predictive procedures, and computational codes. The goal is to build and test these models in a real world recommender system.

Because of its dual nature as an invasive species and potential exploitable resource, the snow crab’s expansion in the Barents Sea has important ecological, economic and political implications, both nationally and internationally. Although available evidence suggests that large decapods play a role in structuring benthic communities, studies considering long-term changes on the structure and function of the ecosystems impacted by large invasive crustaceans are scarce. There is thus an urgent need for empirical data and modelled predictions on the impact of the snow crab in Arctic systems, to ensure that robust management decisions can be implemented to support sustainable value creation and Blue Growth. EISA addresses this challenge in 4 scientific work packages that will use state-of-the-art methods (sampling, ecosystem modelling, genetics and metagenomics and machine learning) to generate cutting-edge knowledge on 1) the changes the crab causes on the structure and function of the benthic communities, including other commercial species (WP1); 2) the dynamics of the snow crab population in the Barents Sea, including the origin of the invasion (WP2); 3) predictions on the snow crab dispersal and impact, in the framework of climate change (WP3); and 4) synthesise all results in a socio-economic and governance framework that can inform management guidelines (WP4). EISA progress and results will be shared with academic fellows, management authorities, industry and society through a dissemination and communication plan to ensure that the latest knowledge on the snow crab is available for the development of robust ecosystem-based management measures and increased sustainable value creation in the Arctic region.

294544,TAPI: Towards autonomy in process industries - Combining data-driven and model-based methods for estimation and control,2019,2023,"The aim of TAPI (Towards Autonomy in Process Industries) is to move Norwegian land-based process industries towards more autonomous operations by exploring the intersection between machine learning (ML) and more traditional model-based control methods. Industry 4.0 marks a new era in industrial markets and digitalization is an international research topic aiming to increase productivity and competitiveness. This can be achieved through increased energy and resource efficiency and improved process autonomy, stability and control system flexibility. The industry partners (Hydro, Elkem, Borregaard and Yara) face similar challenges related to complex, nonlinear processes in harsh environments with largely varying time constants, where only sparse, often manual measurements are available. These issues cannot be fully solved through traditional control methods, and new competence is needed to address them.

The intersection between control theory and ML is an emerging research field with large potential. TAPI will explore, extend and develop new ML methods for control systems that are able to handle the particular challenges of the process industries. To safely apply these control methods in industrial use-cases, this project seeks to significantly advance the understanding and formal analysis of what can be guaranteed with respect to stability, robustness and convergence when using ML methods in control systems, and what is required related to system observability and training data.

The project results are expected to increase the competence level, productivity and competitiveness for Norwegian process industry as well as improve safety for process operators and reduce emissions, use of chemicals and waste production.

294613,French-Norwegian Research Effort on Applied Dialogue Modelling,2019,2020,"As stated above, the scientific exchanges will serve a two-fold objective. The first objective is a generic scientific exchange between the research groups, to foster collaboration on topics such as the creation of multilingual dialogue corpora or the development of socially-competent spoken dialogue systems. The four partners to the project share a common scientific interest in the computational study of human-human and human-machine dialogues.  In particular, the creation of multilingual dialogue corpora is a research topic of special interest to the project partners.  While large multilingual text corpora have become a common resource in the last years, very few of these resources focus on conversations. This scarcity remains an important bottleneck both for foundational research and the development of practical applications.

The second project objective will focus on writing a project proposal to Horizon 2020 on the automatic analysis of emergency calls. Medical emergencies are often characterised by numerous uncertainties, as the emergency operators need to assess a complex medical situation based on a single information source, namely the account of patients or eye witnesses on the phone. These callers are often under high levels of psychological stress and typically have no medical training. Based on the collected information, the operators must quickly decide how to handle the situation and dispatch medical resources (such as doctors or ambulances) accordingly. Harnessing this combination of high uncertainty and strong time constraints is a demanding task which is subject to considerable cognitive and emotional load. The proposed exchange will allow us to prepare in 2019 a concrete project proposal that will investigate whether novel technological solutions (drawing upon speech and language technology, machine learning and dialogue modelling) can help make emergency response services more reliable and effective.",Teknisk-industrielle institutter,Instituttsektor,14781,Pierre Lison,NORSK REGNESENTRAL,Oslo
294636,New Hydrate Management: New understanding of hydrate phenomena in oil systems to enable safe operation within the hydrate zone,2019,2023,"For the petroleum industry, risk-based hydrate management can be a viable strategy for significantly widening the operational window. The traditional approach has been to avoid entering the hydrate region (high pressure and low temperature) altogether by temperature control (insulation and heating), chemicals (methanol and glycols) and pressure control. Although ensuring safe operations these remedies are costly for longer and colder transport conditions and not necessarily environmentally sound. This project will help meet demands of marginal field developments and operations in Artic areas by advancing the new fundamental knowledge of gas hydrate properties and develop methods for risk assessment and cost-effective hydrate management. 

From field experience, it is known that some oil pipelines are easily plugged by gas hydrates while others are transportable. This is commonly accepted to be due to naturally occurring polar components in the crude oils. A main goal is to combine the increased resolution of mass spectrometry (using the SINTEF owned FT-ICR MS) and advanced multivariate data analysis, block chain and machine learning to identify the hydrate-active components in crude oils.

Hydrate properties in terms of plugging risk and transport properties will be measured for a number of crude oil systems (tentatively 30), and extraction of hydrates for analysis will be done. Prediction tools will be developed, relating the structure of possible hydrate active components to the hydrate properties, thus providing new understanding of gas hydrates in crude oil systems and serve as basis for developing new guidelines for risk-based hydrate management. Ultimately the results can be used for input and validation of multiphase flow models necessary for prediciton of safe operation areas for transport within the hydrate region.

294756,Integrating machine learning and genomic prediction for advancing  Norwegian potato cultivar development.,2019,2022,"In the current proposal, we will develop new tools for effective potato (Solanum tuberosum) breeding. For targeted traits, we aim to i) develop fast and reliable high-throughput tools for common scab and potato tuber appearance phenotyping; ii) establish genomic selection as a routine tool in the Norwegian potato breeding program.
Tuber exterior is extremely important for the consumers’ preferances and a cultivar’s market success. The project will target a disease that causes significant out-grading during the food value chain: the skin blemish disease common scab. In order to include this disease into the national potato selection program, a method for fast and reliable quantification needs to be developed. We propose to develop an automated high throughput platform for phenotyping this disease based on visual, near-infrared and thermal signals from an in-door studio set up. The signals will subsequently be analysed using deep learning models such as neural networks and machine learning. The intention is to build robust prediction models for phenotyping large number of samples based on image data.
Genomic selection will be implemented in the national potato breeding program. Phenotypic data from the breeding material of the Norwegian potato breeder (Graminor Ltd.) will be collected and used to build genomic based prediction models for important tuber traits, including common scab, tuber size, tuber uniformity, tuber skin color, etc. The genomic marker data will be derived using the recently developed 22K GGP Potato SNP array. Various statistical approaches will be used for developing the genomic prediction model(s) including genomic best linear unbiased predictions and various Bayesian based approaches. The prediction model(s) will subsequently be validated before being applied to the breeding population for selection.",Primærnæringsinstitutter,Instituttsektor,3000000,Jahn Davik,NIBIO - NORSK INSTITUTT FOR BIOØKONOMI,Ås
294805,More Efficient Utilization of Marine Resources through Multiscale Magnetic Resonance Imaging,2019,2023,"Seafood and aquaculture are a significant part of the Norwegian economy and the sectors will continue to grow in the future. Seafood is now Norway's second largest export. However, there are limits to the quantity of marine life that can be either caught or farmed before there are adverse environmental effects. Therefore, to increase profitability while maintaining sustainability, the fishing industry has a long-term strategy to create value through better resource use and optimization of production methods. It is estimated that up to half of all seafood is wasted. Beyond wasted nutritional value, this also causes significant energy waste and production of greenhouse gases from discarded products. Therefore, creating high-quality products with a long shelf life is important both economically and environmentally. A challenge in achieving this goal is that the underlying properties of a raw material that will lead to a low or high quality final product are often poorly understood.

Advanced multiscale MRI methods will be adapted to yield information on fish tissue microstructure, chemistry and macrostructure. Machine learning algorithms will relate information from the MRI data to visual and sensory properties to determine what tissue properties yield the most desirable products for four different seafood processing methods. Other machine learning models will predict final sample properties based on original sample properties and handling methods. These results will be used to determine what physical and chemical properties of raw materials are most suited for the different processing methods and make recommendations for process optimization.

Generalizability is an important aspect of the project. The project will make the measurement methods and software broad enough such that they can be applied to many types of marine products. Collaboration between Nofima, UiT/UNN, Lund University and UC Berkeley will ensure the research is on the international forefront.",Primærnæringsinstitutter,Instituttsektor,9259000,Kathryn Anderssen,NOFIMA AS,Tromsø
295013,DL: PROVIZ - Prostate cancer visualization by MRI - Improved diagnostics using artificial intelligence,2019,2023,"Prostate cancer affects approximately 1 in 8 men during their lifetime. This number is expected to increase substantially due to the aging population, and new clinical diagnostic tools are urgently needed.  

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become a key component in the diagnostic workup. However, the interpretation of MRI images relies on the manual reading by experienced radiologists, which is a time and cost-intensive resource. Moreover, this process underuses the quantitative nature of the data. We hypothesize that better diagnostic performance is achievable by providing the radiologist with a decision support system based on artificial intelligence (AI). For such a system to work in clinical practice, it needs to be accurate as well as transparent and interpretable. 

We propose to develop a decision support system that combines transparent AI methods, deep learning and model-based imaging features, and clinical information to provide the radiologist with a new set of interpretable tools to more accurately and efficiently detect prostate cancer, differentiate between high-risk and low-risk disease, and target prostate biopsies. The foundation of this project is formed by a unique Norwegian dataset of >1600 patients with MRI examinations and clinical variables, and an interdisciplinary project team with dedicated experience in MRI, AI, urology and radiology. Our collaboration with international experts in the field ensures access to similar data from The Netherlands and Taiwan, enabling solutions that also cover challenges related to demographic and multi-center variance. 

The project has the potential to substantially reduce health care costs, alleviate the demand on medical personnel, and obtain better treatment stratification, less side-effects, and improved quality of life in a relatively short timeframe.

295083,"Teaching the computer to recognise suboptimal skeletal growth/osteochondrosis, to use this in selection for sustainable legs",2019,2022,"The skeleton in the spine and limbs grows by endochondral ossification. The most important disease that affects this process is osteochondrosis, which can be heritably predisposed. Osteochondrosis in joints can give loose fragments (osteochondrosis dissecans); osteochondrosis in growth plates can give angular limb deformities, while osteochondrosis in the spine can give hunchback and other deformities. Loose fragments can progress to painful osteoarthritis. Angled limbs or spine can also lead to abnormal loading and predispose for osteoarthritis, or claw problems that lead to early loss of breeding sows. In sum, there are few other diseases that influence the health, welfare, performance and longevity of pigs to the same extent as osteochondrosis. It is therefore extremely important to prevent this disease through selective breeding. 
All Norwegian potential breeding boars undergo computed tomographic (CT) scanning for automated quantification of lean meat and fat percentage for selection. Osteochondrosis is also manually evaluated in eight different places, something which takes a relatively long time per pig. Meat and fat percentage can be collected based on grey values in the CT scan, but for osteochondrosis it is unfortunately not that simple. We therefore plan to use machine learning, or artificial intelligence, because the technique can solve more complex tasks. In this project, machine learning will consist of a veterinarian marking osteochondrosis lesions in a number of CT scans. Thereafter, the computer will compare the images with and without markings and use so-called neural networks to teach itself to make the same markings as the veterinarian in unlimited numbers of CT scans. 
According to the aims, the computer will first be taught to recognise osteochondrosis in joints, then in growth plates, and finally in the spine, before the three machine learning protocols are joined together to make one model for automated whole-body scoring of osteochondrosis.",Universiteter,UoH-sektor,7202000,Kristin Olstad,NMBU Veterinærhøgskolen,Ås

Produksjon av silisium forbruker store mengder energi, typisk 11-12 MWh/tonn silisium, og dette varierer med hvor godt ovnen produserer. 

I en smelteovn er det bare tilførselen av elektrisk energi og råmaterialer som er styrt automatisk. På grunn av de høye prosesstemperturene er det ingen direkte målinger av indre tilstander i ovnen. Styringen av de kjemiske prosessene er manuell og basert på hvordan driftspersonellet vurderer prosesstilstanden basert på deres observasjoner og erfaring. Det er i dag relativt store variasjoner i produksjonen over tid, og forskjellen i silisiumutbytte mellom gode og dårlige perioder kan være opp til 10%.

Prosjektet ønsker å utvikle et adaptivt beslutningsstøttesystem for prosessoperatører og -ingeniører som vil gi diagnose av ulike ovnstilstander og anbefalinger for hvilke aksjoner som bør gjøres eller hvilke settpunkter som bør endres for at ovnen igjen skal kunne opereres ved optimale betingelser. En riktig diagnose av ovnstilstanden er en forutsetning for å kunne stabilisere driften på et høyere produksjonsnivå og derved redusert energiforbruk. Målet er en reduksjon i energiforbruket på 5%.  

Beslutningsstøttesystemet vil anvende metoder for kunstig intelligens, maskinlæring og digital tvilling for å riktig diagnose av ovnstilstand og velge riktig aksjon basert på diagnosen.

Validated microstructure models for duplex steels will be used together with a finite element simulation of the thermal transport in the macroscopic weld joint geometry. This multi-scale simulation will inform the robot about the integrity of the weld in real time, so that the robot can take corrective measures if needed.

Welmax makes flexible robot solutions that employ laser scanning of the weld groove and the joint geometry to adapt the robot programming to the actual task at hand.  The integration of IFE's cloud-based welding simulation software ""Weldsim as a Service"" with Welmax's adaptive robot welding solutions, will give increased weld consistency over an even wider range of geometric variations, materials and process environments.

We focus on duplex steels, as this is an advanced material which is difficult to weld due to a microstructure which is highly dependent on the temperature history. IFE will improve the mathematical models for these steels, and Sintef Manufacturing will contribute with experiments and characterization to validate the models.

Lung diseases are a growing problem, characterized by:
? increasing prevalence;
? shortage of experienced health personnel and workload pressure;
? economic burden due to direct/indirect cost.

Auscultation is a low-cost, non-invasive procedure to examine lungs. However, its interpretation is subjective and manual, research has shown that clinicians interpret lung sounds differently. There is therefore an unmet need for tools that can eliminate subjectivity, inconsistency and enable wider circles of health staff to provide such examination.

Our solution is easy-to-use: take a digital stethoscope – record lung sounds – sounds are sent to the cloud – get automatic analysis in our platform –  use the platform’s answer to create a record, monitor and communicate the findings further.

? state-of-the art deep learning methods;
? trained on world’s biggest annotated dataset;
? compatible with existing digital stethoscopes.

The solution is based on application of artificial intelligence to automated image capture and diagnostics.
DR is a microvascular complication of diabetes caused by long term damage due to uncontrolled blood glucose levels. It is the leading cause of preventable blindness among adults. An estimated 500 million people globally are affected by diabetes and this number is projected to increase to 650 million by 2045. Within 10 years of onset, 75 percent of diabetics will have some degree of DR. However,  there is a 95% reduction in vision loss due to DR if patients were to receive early screening, accurate diagnosis and timely treatment.
Diabetic retinopathy is difficult to diagnose in its early stages as it is asymptomatic, and hence, screening is the only way to identify such patients to prevent them from going blind. In the developed world only 50% of patients with diabetes get screenings in a given year despite recommendations by the American Diabetes Association. In addition, the gold standard of diagnosing DR i.e. retinal fundus cameras, are expensive and often unavailable in remote or developing parts of the world. 
The Oivi camera addresses these current unmet needs with its automated image capture and diagnosis thereby enabling screening of a large group of DR patients. Oivi enables early diagnosis and  enables inexpensive and early treatment options. Thus preventing vision loss among a huge patient pool.

Labour shortage is one of the major concerns for strawberry growers. There is thus a need for new technology to help growers automate this process. The NORONN project builds on existing developments within the consortium that puts us in a unique position to close the technological gaps needed to make these systems useful for farmers around the world. We have developed a patent pending gripper that allows us to pick strawberries faster and more accurately than our competitors. 

The main challenge is the identification and picking of the strawberry using a robotic arm. The fruits need to be accurately localized in the field. We find the fruits using a deep neural network and find the location in the three-dimensional space using 3D camera. A novel and patent-pending gripper is developed but need to be tested and adjusted.. The IP is owned by ARD INNOVATION on behalf of the Norwegian University of Life Sciences. The gripper picks the berries by enclosing them entirely before picking. This makes us able to pick berries in the presence of uncertainties and moving berries, for example due to wind. We will also equip this gripper with internal sensors that can estimate the ripeness of the berries and evaluate the quality in a enclosed and controlled environment before harvest. 

The main objective of the project is to make sure the IP and technology is exploited in the best possible way to reach a global market. This includes proof-of-concept of the technology, developing a business plan.",Næringsliv,Næringsliv,4467000,Katharina Asting,NORONN AS,Ås
296216,Automation of field inspection in large scale solar farms - Alspin,2019,2022,"The goal is to realize efficient and automated system for solar module inspection and optimize energy production (i.e. high yield and warranty claims) in large scale solar installations. Solar is the fastest growing segment in the energy industry, because of the simple installation and short time to production. Solar farms now contain more than 1 million individual modules, requiring larger space and continuous maintenance for keeping high productivity. Having recently changed its name, Equinor (formerly Statoil) has a mission to invest in renewable energy and to develop its business within green energy. Through joint ventures with Scatech Solar, Equinor intends to use the global presence to expand the portfolio to become a diversified energy company where solar will be part of Equinor new businesses to put the company at the front of green energy industries. An efficient, automated and autonomous inspection and analysis system will be an important tool for both monitoring their investment and optimizing the yield.
Manual inspection of solar systems in the field is common today. Interpretation of the IR thermal images is complicated by artefacts that appear in data and dirt on modules, which may not be easily distinguishable from faults. Also, correlation between visual and electrical data is often not practical. With the large installations of today, manual inspection is no longer efficient. Therefore, sophisticated approaches are necessary to determine when defects have a sufficient impact on the energy production to warrant replacement of solar modules.
This project aims to realize fault models from the field arrays, high-resolution and multispectral sensing for automated airborne monitoring and inspection from remote distances. Machine learning will be established to correlate inspection with electrical data to evaluate the impact of the defects on the production. A cost-benefit analysis will be integrated to control the operation and maintenance of solar farms.",Næringsliv,Næringsliv,8000000,Ahmed Nabil Belbachir,EQUINOR ASA,Stavanger
296266,"Ny sensorikk og maskinlæring for optimal utfôring, redusert slamproduksjon og bedre vannmiljø i lukkede anlegg",2019,2022,"Landbasert produksjon av fisk er i raskt vekst, både i biomasse og i variasjon av arter, og når det gjelder smolt og post-smolt viser industriel spesielt interesse for å produsere post-smolt opp til 1000 g. Resirkulasjonsanlegg (RAS) velges normalt for vannbehandling ved nybygg, og anleggene blir stadig større. Det blir derfor stadig viktigere å kunne observere, tolke, avgjøre og handle på et rasjonelt og etterprøvbart grunnlag. SINTEF har introdusert Precision Fish Farming som et konsept der målet er å benytte metoder innenfor instrumentering, reguleringsteknikk og matematisk modellering for å monitorere, styre og dokumentere produksjonen. 

Hovedfokus i YNGELSENS vil være å utvikle nye, kamerabaserte sensorer for å overvåke og parameterisere (tallfeste) fiskeatferd og knytte atferd opp mot regulering og optimalisering av utfôring for å redusere slamproduksjon og bedre vannkvalitet. Disse sensorene finnes ikke i dag og vil kunne gi uvurderlige, objektive målinger i sanntid. I dag er røkting av yngelen erfaringsbasert og subjektiv, i tillegg til intervallbasert. Dermed kan en ikke beskrive og dokumentere atferden kvantitativt. Metodeutvikling for å beskrive atferden omfatter for eksempel fôratferd / respons, posisjon i tank mellom fôringer, individuelle variasjoner og avvik i svømmemønster, størrelse og farge, og respons på ekstremverdier i vannmiljø.

Vannmiljøet monitoreres og skal via labforsøk relateres til videoanalyse. Hydrogensulfid (H2S) er en betydelig biologisk risikofaktor i RAS. En typisk reaksjon hos fisk på H2S eksponering er flukt og unngåelse av områder med forhøyede konsentrasjoner. Systematisk adferdsovervåkning har derfor et høyt potensial for å indikere forhøyede H2S konsentrasjoner i RAS. 

Potensialet med sensorer som beskrevet over er blant annet styrt utfôring slik at det blir mindre slam, mindre potensielt skadelige sulfatreduserende bakterier (SRB) som kan produsere H2S, samt mer robust smolt med bedre fiskehelse og fòrfaktor.",Næringsliv,Næringsliv,6000000,Torfinn Solvang,MOWI NORWAY AS,Bergen
296388,New breeding strategies for better longevity and animal welfare in future crossbred sows,2019,2022,"The TN70 sow is a cross between Landrace and Large White and is one of the most important animals in the pig production chain, as she produces the largest number of piglets and is very popular due to her excellent mothering ability. We aim to improve another trait in the TN70 sow, longevity, its ability to produce a high number of litters without reduced health and animal welfare. It is vital for the development of Norwegian swine genetics that we work even better towards improved longevity in the future. The trait is difficult to evaluate in purebred nucleus animals, as this would lead to a reduced turnover of animals, and thus a reduction in genetic gain. Solving this challenge within the current framework is tough. Several approaches to solve this problem have been attempted in the past with limited success. Part of the challenge is the differences that occur due to some animals being purebreds and some animals being crossbred. This creates statistical challenges due to differences in interactions between genes depending on whether they are from purebreds or crossbreds, and different interactions between genotypes and the environment. We will develop new methods for evaluating longevity through big data approaches such as machine learning and the inclusion of sensor technology to evaluate conditions at herd level. Building knowledge in the field of sensor technology and big data approaches is crucial for the future. The project findings will lead to increased genetic progress in longevity in the crossbred sows. This has the potential to increase international sales of pigs and semen with Norwegian genetics. For farmers, this will mean less culling of sows, and a reduction of replacement gilts, which is one of the largest costs. This will lead to improved economy for Norwegian pork producers, more sustainable food production, and more robust and healthier animals leading to better animal welfare. Less expensive food and improved food quality will benefit society.",Næringsliv,Næringsliv,4305820,Maja Winther Iversen,NORSVIN R&D AS,Hamar
296429,"Develop Airport Logistics Intelligence (ALI) , a system for optimizing flow of baggage using AI and prediction.",2019,2023,"Air traffic is increasing rapidly. IATA has mandated resolution 753 that requires bags to be scanned at 4 points: check-in, aircraft loading, transfers between aircraft and on arrival. However, seen from a security perspective and the core purpose of BHS, it is also necessary to keep track of the bag through the whole flow in the BHS. By tracking bags through the whole Baggage Handling System, performing continuous analysis and prediction, operators of airports can predict heavy baggage flow, if the system requires maintenance or is appropriering breakdown states. 

To accomplish this, a number of classification and prediction algorithms needs to be developed and tuned, AI methods needs to be investigated and neural networks need to be developed and trained. To improve situational awareness a dashboard that provides operators with a real-time status and salient predictions, need to be developed and fine tuned to reduce information overload. The big data platform provides the basis for preemptive and predictive capabilities and it need to transform and merge data into various applied statistical time series analysis, neural networks and supervised/ reinforcement learning. Among the hardest of the challenges, is how to apply video-data for inventory and flow control and how to properly distribute and optimize Agent responsibilities in the Multi Agent System.  

Assuming a successful project, airport operators will be able to leverage existing data to decrease congestion, reduce cost of maintenance and breakdowns, energy use, personell costs and to more efficiently employ existing BHS eliminating needs for upgrades. Airlines will be able to better coordinate the flow of baggage to reduce delays on tight of delayed transfers in accordance to the principles of priority and fairness.

This project aims to advance fraud prevention and customer lifetime value (LTV) prediction using artificial intelligence (AI) to prevent ad spending on malicious and low-quality traffic sources. The development of entirely new transparent, resilient, and adaptive fraud detection algorithms combined with accurate and timely predictive LTV modeling could redefine digital media buying and completely reshape the digital life of every company and every individual who is connected to the internet through any type of device.

The most significant R&D challenges facing the project are largely related to engineering and artificial intelligence. The scalability required to train models using millions of data points at high speeds is difficult to design for. Another unique challenge is presented by the fact that millions of models will need to be stored for every client to achieve the most detailed level of insights possible. This type of scale is quite rare in machine learning and unprecedented in advertising technology. Also, developing algorithms that combine many artificial intelligence techniques to detect fraud based on fundamental traits and signatures so they are adaptable to all current and future manifestations requires a significant leap in several disciplines of machine learning.

Det er flere aktører som i dag jobber med løsninger for tilstandskontroll av maritimt utstyr og en fellesnevner for disse ser ut til å være at prediksjon av tilstand ofte er basert på enkel tidsserieanalyse med forhåndsdefinerte alarmgrenser. 

Dagens løsninger benytter i liten grad nye muligheter i maskinlæring og avanserte algoritmer som kan beskrive tilstanden for utstyret i sanntid. Kombinert med et stadig økende antall sensorer gir dette nye muligheter innen automatisk tilstandskontroll. I tillegg kan man dra nytte av utstyrsleverandørenes (OEM) erfaring og kunnskap om egne produkter bedre enn hva utstyrsnøytrale tredjepartsaktører (og generiske overvåkningssystemer) kan levere. 

Prosjektets idé er å utvikle og implementere et system der utstyrsleverandørenes produktkunnskap overføres til kunstig intelligens som benyttes til tilstandskontroll og beslutningstaking om bord og på land. Dette er en innovasjon i verdensklasse som øker konkurransekraften for en utstyrsleverandør nasjonalt og internasjonalt.

Gjennom økt innsikt i produkters faktiske bruk og automatiske tilstandsmål, kan en produsent og utstyrsleverandør bidra til å veilede sluttkunden til bedre bruk av produktet, eksempelvis bidra til et bruksmønster som vil kunne virke livsforlengende og/eller vedlikeholdsreduserende. 

For utstyrsleverandører vil denne innovasjonen kreve en endring og utvikling av forretningsmodeller for å kapitalisere innovasjonen. Selv om teknologien nå er av tilstrekkelig modenhetsgrad, så utfordrer dette dagens forretningsmodeller.

The challenge is that as many as 20% of potential dangerous anomalies are missed during examinations. This is a situation that can be mitigated by an automatic disease detection system assisting the clinicians in real-time.
We propose to deploy a small device running an artificial intelligence (AI) system which is connected directly to the video output of medical endoscopy equipment. The AI will, in real-time, make doctors aware of potential anomalies in the endoscopy image in order to aid the doctor and improve anomaly detection rates. The current AI prototype has GI disease detection rates at least as good as current state-of-the-art academic research, but has superior speed for scale and real-time feedback.

296586,Hydraulics Influx Tracking (HIT) – Real-time monitoring gas expansion while circulating out an influx,2019,2021,"More than 50% of the petroleum resources on the Norwegian continental shelf is still unused. Most simple wells are already drilled and drilling is becoming increasingly complex, either due to reduced drilling window in mature fields with depletion or injection for production support, or due to targeting reserves in more difficult reservoirs, such as high pressure, high temperature, extended reach, or karstified carbonate reservoirs. Developing improved technology for pressure control in drilling is therefore one of the most important measures for improved recovery on the Norwegian continental shelf.

Currently, no technology exists that is capable of reliably monitoring the integrity of the mud barrier in case of gas expanding in the riser while drilling. This is a critical uncertainty when drilling in formations with losses, where a loss may mask gas displacing the mud column in the riser and compromising the integrity of the mud barrier. Tracking expansion of gas is key to distinguish gas expanding in annulus from simultaneous losses or influx while drilling, and is vital to be able to assess the integrity of the mud column.

We will in this project solve fundamental challenges related to enable reliable real-time monitoring the integrity of the mud barrier in case of gas influx. This will result in new technology that will remove considerable uncertainty associated with the handling of well control incidents in drilling, which will be invaluable for HPHT (high pressure, high temperature) and deep water operations in order to prevent influx scenarios from escalating into severe incidents. In particular, the project will bridge the lack of technology for reliable monitoring gas migration when drilling in formations with losses, such as e.g. karstified carbonates.",Næringsliv,Næringsliv,7350000,Geir Arne Evjen,KELDA DYNAMICS AS,Porsgrunn
296615,Detection of weak snow layer on skis using radar and machine learning,2019,2022,"Off-piste skiing have grown tremendously in popularity, and 1 in 3 skiers and snowboarders now venture away from prepared slopes. This increases exposure to steep and avalanche-prone terrain, so the number of skiers who have been harmed by avalanches is steadily growing. Current avalanche products are designed for rescue rather than prevention, so skiers must rely on their own assessments of the snow and terrain conditions to avoid risky areas.  This method is often inadequate and consequently, 9 of 10 skier involved avalanches are triggered by the skiers themselves. Very often a persistent weak snow layer, unseen by the skiers, causes the avalanche and too often, loss of human life. 
Knowledge of avalanche danger is essential for safe skiing, especially in remote, high mountain areas.  Regional forecasting, topographic maps and weather reports offer avalanche risk indicators, but these are based on extrapolations from few data points, and do not offer accurate location specific information.  Our project is the engineering of a portable, light-weight, low-cost radar solution combined with other sensors: GPS, gyro, temperature and tilt, for skiers in the backcountry. It is the first mass-market device for real-time data acquisition and analysis of the snow conditions.  It digitally measures a full snow profile including weak layers and snow depth, as well as slope gradient and applied forces. This technology will keep skiers constantly informed about the snow conditions under them, no matter their location. This data is not only useful to the skier, but to ski resorts, hydropower plants, militaries, insurance companies, climate researchers and others.
Our 1st milestone will be the automation of weak snow layer detection using machine learning. Then we will look into integrating other sources of data (weather, gyro ,etc..) to provide localized avalanche risk information and look into communicating it in such a way that it does not encourage more risk-taking behavior.",Næringsliv,Næringsliv,6405481,Wayne Stasinowsky,THINK OUTSIDE AS,Bergen

Blant foredragsholderne er Claire Taylor (Institutt for energiteknikk), Patrick Waldemar (Telenor), Walter Qvam (Digital Norway), Torbjörn Holmström (Volvo), Morten Dalsmo (Sintef), Hilde Lowett (Teknologirådet), Olav Madland (Applied Autonomy). Anne Kjersti Fahlvik fra Forskningsrådet deltar i en panelsamtale sammen LO, NHO og Innovasjon Norge. 

Arrangementet er utformet for å gi deltakerne svar på spørsmål som:

- Hvordan kommer man som enkeltbedrift videre med digitalisering og automatisering?
- Hvordan sørger vi for at utviklingen blir trygg for menneskene som skal leve med den?
- Hvilke kunnskapsmiljøer kan bidra i utviklingen av norske bedrifter?

Digitalisering og automatisering muliggjør både omstilling til et bærekraftig samfunn og nye, mer effektive og ressursbesparende måter å drive produksjon og tilby tjenester på. Utfordringen er at mange styrer, ledere og ansatte i private og offentlige virksomheter mangler kompetanse om hvordan man skal gå i gang med digitaliseringen og hvordan vår arbeidshverdag kommer til å endres fremover. Med Teknologiforum ønsker NTVA å bidra til å gi deltakerne det det store bildet, peke på verktøyene for å komme seg videre og invitere til dialog. Kunnskapen vil bli delt videre i NTVA kanaler i etterkant.

NTVA ønsker også at arrangementet bidrar til oppfølging av Næringslivets perspektivmelding og Digital21, og utvikler grunnlaget for et strategisk NTVA-prosjekt med arbeidstittelen «Smart næringsliv».",Øvrige andre,Øvrige,50000,Hans Kåre Flø,NORGES TEKNISKE VITENSKAPSAKADEMI NTVA,Trondheim
297113,OXIMONITOR: The first portable monitoring medical device providing accurate prognosis for patients with circulatory failure,2018,2021,"ODI Medical is a Norwegian start-up company that has invented the Oxygen Delivery Index (ODIN), a “physiological biomarker” that allows to precisely quantify O2 delivery. Thanks to the support from both institutional (e.g. The Research Council of Norway or Innovation Norway) and corporate (e.g. Novo Nordisk Foundation) funding bodies, we have been able to develop OXIMONITOR, the first-ever medical device accurately measuring the microcirculatory function. Our technology is based on 30 years of research conducted by Professor Knut Kvernebo (MD, PhD) from Oslo University Hospital. 

ODI Medical's solution is the OXIMONITOR which is a bedside, accurate and cost-effective fully integrated platform incorporating 2 main components: 

(1) The mLab is a non-invasive point of care (POC) device that uses computer assisted video microscopy and diffuse reflectance spectroscopy to create an “optical fingerprint” of the patient’s circulatory function. Data is collected from the surface of the patient’s skin, but could also be collected from the conjunctiva or sublingually. 

(2) The cLab component is a cloud computing system based on machine learning technology that collects and, analyses the data and generates the patient´s interpretation report. This report is then sent back to the clinical site through a user-friendly dashboard for decision-making. The prognostic value from OXIMONITOR has been confirmed in a proof-of-concept clinical trial with ECMO patients and a follow-up multi-center clinical trial including over 60 patients (interim data). Our goal is to complete the development of the platform and start commercializing it in hospitals and other healthcare institutions to treat ECMO patients as a 1 st clinical application by 2021.

Our technology is at TRL6 (figure 6), having a working prototype where cLab and mLab are integrated. We successfully tested our prototype at OUH (Oslo University Hospital) in a proof-of-concept clinical trial.",Næringsliv,Næringsliv,50000,Alison Sundset,ODI MEDICAL AS,Oslo
297122,MARie Curie Intelligent UltraSound,2018,2019,"A typical cardiac ultrasound examination takes 30-40 minutes; additional image analysis and reporting will often double this time. Thus, cardiologists are calling for simplification and automation to optimize clinical workflows towards more time with patients and less time on analysis/reporting tasks. 

To bridge the gap between clinical needs and currently available technology for the assessment of cardiac diseases, there is a need to develop competence in EU. New tools, capable of assisting the user to increased efficiency and accelerated decision making, are needed. Such tools can be crafted by introducing intelligent algorithms that can exploit knowledge from expert users and previously acquired data and learn from this. However, several factors hinder progress:
• Emerging tools for automated image classification cannot go beyond structure recognition in order to also provide cardiac performance- and diagnostic metrics
• Lack of large training databases with curated echocardiographic data linked to pathophysiological findings
• Lack of researchers capable of operating across the integrated fields of ultrasound image processing, machine learning, cardiology and physiology.

We will build on recent research breakthroughs in machine learning (deep Learning), which have boosted the performance substantially for speech recognition and image classification. The ambition is to develop tools that will lead to increased diagnostic confidence as well as significantly enhanced operational efficiency.

Through training and knowledge development in a focused research project - to be carried under the MSCA-ITN-EID framework, MARCIUS will provide researchers trained with the cross-disciplinary understanding and skills necessary to develop enabling technologies in an industrial and clinical setting. The longer-term outcome of the project is new products, which will benefit patients across Europe and worldwide directly by advancing the state of care within cardiology.",Næringsliv,Næringsliv,200000,Eigil Samset,GE VINGMED ULTRASOUND AS,Horten
297153,"The association between physical behaviour and chronic low back 
and neck pain: Acquiring data from the Norwegian HUNT4 Study",2019,2020,"The funding applied for in the current proposal will be used to acquire data on about 10 000 participants in the ongoing 4th survey of the Nord-Trøndelag Health Study (HUNT4). The data will be used to expand the ongoing EU-funded Back-UP project. In HUNT4, we are collecting 7-days physical behaviour data with two accelerometers attached to the skin on the right thigh and low back. By utilising state-of-the-art machine-learning techniques, we have developed a data model that classify time with sitting, standing, walking, running, cycling and lying down with an overall accuracy of about 95%. Along with the recordings of physical behaviour, a range of other relevant health parameters are collected in HUNT4, including pain in low back and neck. The HUNT4 data collection started in September 2017 and runs until February 2019. Based on the current participation rate, we will obtain objective measurements of physical behaviour from about 33 000 people. Thus, these data provide and a unique opportunity to study the association between physical behaviour and neck and/or low back pain. To establish the HUNT4 dataset, it is necessary to 1) perform a quality check and clean the data (e.g., some participants removed one or both sensors before the end of the 7-day recording, some sensor may have malfunctions etc.), 2) process the data with our most up-to-date model to classify time with different physical behaviours, and 3) extract a limited number of other health data relevant for the prognostic model. We foresee that 3-4 person-months are required to create the HUNT4 dataset. The dataset will have significant impact on the quality and potential impact of the prognostic models developed in Back-UP. Moreover, the uniqueness of the physical behaviour data in HUNT4, and the potential for ground-breaking research based on these data, will strengthen our possibilities for attracting further EU funding.",Universiteter,UoH-sektor,283000,Paul Jarle Mork,Institutt for samfunnsmedisin og sykepleie,Trondheim
297165,VipiCash Intelligent Monitor - A monitoring tool for global remittance and Aid Markets using Artificial Intelligence technology.,2019,2019,"Wiht VipiCash the sender, an individual or organization, specify goods and services to be collected by the receiver instead of money, removing overhead and distribution fees and reducing the risk of misuse, corruption and terror funding. The innovation of VIM is a personalized intelligent monitoring tool using Artificial Intelligence technology and mathematical-statistical modelling approaches to interpret huge amounts of data giving personalized information and advises enabling informed remittance and aid donation decisions. This markets have traditionally been characterized by lack of transparency, being subject to manipulation in the form of corruption, money laundering, terror financing and high transfer fees. As late as 2015, a report from the National Auditors of Norway showed that no one could account for NOK 26 billion in aid funds in the period 2004 to 2012. This challenges the public’s trust and reduces remittance and donation efficiency.First of all, the sender/donor needs a priori to trust in the receiver actually receives the good. Regional or national factors such as political stability and level of violence, government level of corruption control change over time might challenge this. For example, the occurrence of a political coup or a general increased corruption tendency in the region might refrain a sender from remitting large amounts of money to a friend or family member, but instead remit smaller amounts more often. Other events, such as natural and human disasters, are examples of relevant factors affecting the remittance decision making. Also, having knowledge of general remittance and aid trends is helpful when deciding when and how much to remit or donate. 
VIM will in a novel way integrate a wide range of data, both quantitative (structured) data and more qualitative (unstructured) data such as news events and reports.",Næringsliv,Næringsliv,50000,Olivier Mukuta,VIPICASH AS,Oslo
297180,Optimizing the Use of Marine Seismic Sources,2019,2021,"As a leader on the market, CGG offers state-of-the-art marine seismic acquisition technologies, developed to address specific imaging objectives. Seismic imaging is a geophysical technique that investigates the subsurface and gives vital information about its properties. Such features can give oil and gas companies a more astute indication if a prospect area contains hydrocarbons. The quality of the seismic data therefore is crucial. The marine seismic air-gun source plays a key role in seismic imaging. This project focuses on a novel use of marine seismic sources. 
Conventional marine seismic surveys today are conducted by a vessel towing two to three seismic sources combined in source arrays. The aim of this work, based on new research effort, is to move towards an acquisition setup where several distributed sources will be used instead. The actual configuration of this multi-source layout such as number of sources, positioning, size (volume), firing rate, steering and other criteria is of utmost importance. Practically speaking, these will be analyzed in detail by conducting modeling studies. In such a way, the R&D team will be able to understand the impact on the final seismic image. The multi-source concept aims to improve the image quality. This is possible as such kind of acquisition configuration brings the missing 'near offset' coverage. Additionally, by having more widely-spaced sources deployed, a larger subsurface area is covered as opposed to conventional survey. In this way, the acquisition efficiency is improved.
Based on the work following this project, the knowledge and expertise about the multi-source acquisition will be improved. This knowledge and expertise is even more relevant in areas where dealing with subtle and complex prospects such as in the Barents Sea and North Sea. As a result, the anticipated outcome is to propose an 'optimal' source configuration for a specific geophysical imaging solution.",Næringsliv,Næringsliv,1689000,Hege Nielsen,CGG SERVICES (NORWAY) AS,Oslo
297186,Northern Lights Deep Learning Workshop 2019,2019,2019,"Northern Lights Deep Learning (NLDL) Workshop, Tromsø 9-10 January 2019 

The workshop is non-profit and will be organized at UiT The Arctic University of Norway. Robert Jenssen, the head of the Machine Learning Group at UiT, will be the General Chair, with Michael Kampffmeyer (UiT) and Arnt-Børre Salberg (Norwegian Computing Center) as the co-chairs. Jenssen has previously been the General Chair for SCIA 2017 and NLDL 2018 which also received IKTPLUSS funding and were a large success. The group has several projects
ongoing related to ICT and funded over IKTPLUSS, and this workshop will hugely 
benefit those projects.

The workshop program will consist of presentations and poster sessions, where participants can present recent work. Participants that would like to present their work will be asked to submit a one-page abstract. Additionally, there will be a panel discussion, where issues and recent developments in the field will be discussed. 

We have invited 5 high-profile keynote speakers. This will contribute to the quality and also increase the visibility of the workshop. However, this also leads to expenses, such as plane journeys and hotels, that need to be covered. We estimate these costs to be 80 000 NOK. 

In addition to this, we will use the conference organizing company Xtenso AS, who will provide help with setting up registration (e.g. credit card payment, budgets). Overall, we estimate a total of 40 participants, which would result in an overall direct cost of 190 KNOK (see budget below). 

To cover these costs, UiT The Arctic University of Norway contributes with 22KNOK (20 hours at an hourly rate of 1100,- NOK) of Jenssen's salary. Additionally, 100 KNOK will be used that are allocated in the FRIPRO project no. 239844 to organize a workshop in 2018. Budgeting for 40 participants, this means that we estimate a deficit of 90 KNOK and we hope that with help of 90 KNOK from IKTPLUSS we will be able to roughly break-even.",Universiteter,UoH-sektor,47955,Robert Jenssen,Institutt for geovitenskap,Tromsø
297244,Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning Models with Applications in Radio Resource Management,2018,2022,"Hensikten med prosjektet er å utvikle nye maskinlæringsmetoder for å løse problemer innen feltet styring og kontroll av hjemmenettverk. Hovedproblemet i hjemmenettverk er å kontrollere og fordele de begrensede ressursene i det ulisensierte radiospekteret. Mangelen på styring av radioressursene forårsaker uforutsigbar tjenestekvalitet for sluttbrukerne, noe som resulterer i dårlige brukeropplevelser. Eksisterende metoder er ikke i stand til å levere god styring av radioressursene på grunn av mengden og variasjonen i tilkoblede enheter og bruksmønstre. Det er ikke lenger mulig å stille inn rutere på en slik måte at alle brukere får en god brukeropplevelse uten å ha kontinuerlig måling og kontroll av ressursbruken. Det har dukket opp mange metoder innen feltet maskinlæring i senere år som virker lovende for å løse disse utfordringene, men mer forskning kreves. 

Det har blitt gjort en god del forskning på bruk av maskinlæringsmetoder for nettverksoptimalisering, med oppmuntrende resultater. Mye av den eksisterende forskningen baserer seg på simulerte nettverk. I dette prosjektet vil forskningsspørsmålene i hovedsak besvares gjennom empiriske studier utført i faktiske hjemmenettverk. Domos har tilgang til et stort antall hjemmerutere. Innsamlet data fra disse ruterne, samt muligheten til å kontrollere innstillingene på ruterne, danner grunnlag for å kjøre eksperimenter og empirisk evaluere både prediksjonsmodeller og kontrollmetoder i stor skala. Dette muliggjør bedre vurdering av hvilke av de eksisterende metodene som fungerer best i praksis, og danner grunnlag for forskning på hvordan eksisterende metoder kan videreutvikles og forbedres. 

Radionettverk har en spesiell hierarkisk struktur, og dette skaper utfordringer som gjør at man ikke bare kan plugge inn eksisterende maskinlæringsmetoder. Ny forskning må til for å tilpasse eksisterende maskinlæringsmetoder til de aktuelle problemene, og her vil det skapes både ny kunnskap og nye ferdigheter.",Næringsliv,Næringsliv,1662000,Olav Nedrelid,DOMOS AS,Oslo

298355,Bayesian machine learning strategy for oil and gas production networks.,2019,2022,"Mål for prosjektet er å utvikle en strategi for maskinlæringsbaserte modeller av olje og gass produksjonsnettverk.

Produksjonsnettverket starter ved oljebrønnenes grenseflate mot oljereservoaret og slutter med separering av olje, gass og vann i prosessanlegget ved produksjonsplattformen. 

Det har vært en rask utvikling i innhenting og distribuering av måledata fra produksjonsnettverkene. Dette har skjedd i takt med en økende interesse for maskinlæring og kunstig intelligens. Men, vi ser at de praktiske anvendelsene i olje og gass-produksjon har vært vanskelige å realisere. Utfordringene skyldes begrenset informasjonsinnhold i dataene, og at dataene kommer på en form som er krevende å utnytte fullt ut.

Solution Seeker ønsker å benytte maskinlæring og kunstig intelligens til å besvare spørsmål som «Hva skjer i prosessen nå?», og «Hvordan vil prosessen reagere på endringer i kontrollvariablene?». Første steg mot realisering av dette, er å utvikle en modelleringsstrategi som kombinerer teoretisk kunnskap, ingeniørerfaring, og prosessdata i samme modell. Strategien må produsere hardføre modeller som tydelig kommuniserer usikkerhet i estimatene. Disse modellene vil kunne ta roller som ekspertkommentator for prosessens tilstand, sparringspartner i analysearbeid, og rådgiver til optimering av prosessens innstillinger.

Forskningen i prosjektet vil gjøres på data fra felter som Solution Seeker samarbeider med, og vil settes ut i pilotprosjekter underveis der det er hensiktsmessig. Arbeidet utføres i tett samarbeid med Matematisk institutt ved Universitetet i Oslo. Metodene som anvendes vil primært være kunstige nevrale nettverk og Bayesiansk statistikk.

Today, there is no existing solution able to handle the massive amounts of data available in many operations in a easily digestible format by machine learning algorithms. Instead, the problem size has to be broken down in subsets, or simplified down to a manageable problem size. This is far from ideal when trying to solve complicated relational problems.

One of our target sectors is the large-scale production industry (f.ex. oil, gas, and aluminum), and we are developing an analytics platform that provides the resources and tools necessary for massive-scale data collection, managed real-time operations, and analytics based on artificial intelligence. This will enable the industry sector companies to optimize their production and also prevent the occurrence of accidents with irreversible effect on the environment.

The main objective of the SME Phase 2 proposal is to fully finance the development from TRL6 to TRL9 and to secure sufficient funding for the market introduction of AIA MFlux.

298390,Novel Intensive-Care-Unit technology for improved survival post- cardiac arrest & resuscitation by closed-loop brain and nerve stimulation,2018,2019,"Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) have become the mainstay technology of resuscitation after cardiac arrest. It is well established that electrical stimulation can re-start the arrested myocardium and therapeutically modulate the heart beat rythm. Yet a similar resuscitation technology to facilitate the recovery of physiologically normal brain activity in the critical hours following cardiac resuscitation does not currently exist.

After a cardiopulmonary arrest and return of spontaneous circulation, 80% of all patients reach the ICU in a comatose state and of these patients, only 20% will survive and regain consciousness. Moreover, as many as 45% of the pediatric patients will die within 1 week after cardiac resuscitation despite having recovered spontaneous circulation, of which 81% are pronounced dead or disconnected from life-support due to neurological damage. A key indicator of such damage is the insufficient recovery of normal EEG activity or the bilateral absence of N20 waves of short-latency somato sensory evoked potentials. While therapeutic hypothermia and fever avoidance provide some neuroprotection, new technologies are clearly needed to support the recovery of normal brain patterns after resuscitation and increase survival.

Recently, one of the partners in the DeepSpark consortium discovered of hypoxia-resilient neurons in the cortex of primates up to 2 hours after total arrest of cardiac activity. We propose that closed-loop selective brain stimulation, time-locked to these neuronal pools, could serve as a trigger of EEG pattern normalization.

Artificial Intelligence deep-learning will be used to set optimal stimulation parameters for vagus nerve and transcranial stimulation as a function of real-time EEG, transcranial infra-read oxygenation and metabolic data, and doppler ultra-sound blood flow information.

The technology developed by the consortium could become a key tool against irreversible decay of brain activity after resuscitation.",Næringsliv,Næringsliv,500000,Enric Claverol,AFFERENT TECHNOLOGIES AS,Oslo
298646,Improved personalized medicine through machine learning in mental disorders (IMPLEMENT),2019,2022,"Psychotic disorders are severe mental illnesses with early onset, frequently chronic course and often lifelong impairment. As a consequence, they cause an enormous healthcare burden, costing close to €100 billion annually in Europe alone. The biology of these illnesses is insufficiently understood and no objective tools exist to aid in diagnosis or treatment selection. This leads to long periods of inadequate and ineffective treatment, significantly limiting the opportunity for achieving more optimal clinical outcomes. To address this, IMPLEMENT will develop a translational research framework that identifies biomarkers for treatment-relevant stratification of the most severe psychotic disorder, schizophrenia. Building on known candidates, IMPLEMENT will use advanced machine learning on high-dimensional multi-OMICS and brain scans to identify illness-associated profiles indexing patient subgroups. Using big data approaches (n > 60,000), IMPLEMENT will explore the impact of genetic risk and neurodevelopmental processes on the formation of biological subgroups and use clinical studies of conventional antipsychotic treatment and innovative treatment approaches to tune subgroup profiles towards clinical utility. The IMPLEMENT framework will incorporate preclinical validation to leverage neurobiological understanding and optimize biological subgroup profiles. The clinical utility of these profiles will be validated in independent clinical samples and prospectively recruited subjects. IMPLEMENT will integrate these efforts with ICT development, to optimize the use of high-dimensional datasets across diverse repositories, to optimally harmonize data for personalized medicine investigations and safeguard patient privacy. Overall, IMPLEMENT will provide the basis for biologically-informed personalized medicine approaches in schizophrenia, addressing an enormous unmet medical need in an area of medicine in which currently no robust clinical stratification tools exist.",Universiteter,UoH-sektor,2914000,Lars Tjelta Westlye,Psykologisk institutt,Oslo

Two essential assets that are required in order to facilitate this goal, by harmonizing consumption with production and by guarantying the cost-effectiveness and the stability of electricity grids, are: i) flexibility asset (Demand Side Management - DSM and Energy Storage Systems - ESS) management systems, and ii) accurate forecasts (for various markets and RES production).
In this evolving landscape, the FLEXGRID project proposes a holistic future smart grid architecture able to accommodate high renewable energy sources (RES) penetration through the development and the interaction of: i) innovative models that exploit recent advances in game theory in order to quantify and highly improve the trade-off between the various future energy markets requirements (which must be Real Time, Efficient, Strategy Proof, Competitive, Scalable, Fair and Privacy Protecting), ii) models that use advanced optimization theory towards innovative Optimal Power Flow (OPF) algorithms (which must be Scalable, Low Overhead, Multi-period, Robust and Network Upgrade Planning Aware) and iii) innovative Business Models (BMs), through the use of artificial intelligence (AI), which can be exploited by modern Energy Service Providers (ESPs) and RES Producers (RESPs) through their efficient interaction with FLEXGRID’s advanced markets and OPF algorithms.
Thus, FLEXGRID facilitates: i) DSOs/TSOs to manage safely and at low cost their electricity grid by interacting with ESPs and RESPs through a liberalized procedure, ii) modern ESPs (able to participate in all the future energy markets) to become more competitive and sustainable, and iii) RESPs to optimally compose and exploit their production in a risk-averse manner.",Næringsliv,Næringsliv,50000,Qazi Sohail Ahmad,SMART INNOVATION NORWAY AS,Halden

298842,Improved Treatments of Acute Myeloid Leukaemias by Personalised Medicine,2019,2022,"Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is a highly aggressive cancer with few treatment options for the majority of patients. Since alterations in cell signalling are a hallmark of the cancer, drugs targeting signalling pathways are being developed. A major challenge is the inter- and intra-tumour heterogeneity of AML patients. The dynamic development of cancer subclones makes it difficult to provide appropriate treatment options. To tackle these challenges, we initially focus on a rare AML subtype, pure erythroleukaemia (PEL) to develop a pipeline to elucidate pathological mechanisms and subsequently adapt it to other AML subtypes.
Our translational approach with access to AML biobanks as well as longitudinal data from clinical trials provides a high quality source for big data analytics and mathematical modelling and encompasses the implementation of data management to ensure data interoperability, reusability, patient security and outreach to patient organisations and public.
We pursue an integrative approach for early identification of responders to novel signalling- targeted drugs. The subclonal architecture of individual AML patients and their signalling status are mapped by mass and flow cytometry and validated by quantitative proteomics. The quantitative multiomics and clinical data are combined with methods for machine learning to develop AML classifiers. To predict clonal evolution, longitudinal cell population and single cell data are utilised to establish mechanism-based dynamic pathway models. With these models it is possible to improve our AML classifiers and to predict optimal treatment for individual patients, performing proof-of-concept validation in in vitro and in vivo models.
AML_PM develops pipelines for clinical decision-making that enable next generation diagnostics for AML and tailoring treatment for individual AML patients. This personalised medicine approach promises to transform aggressive leukaemia into chronic disease and contribute to cure.",Universiteter,UoH-sektor,3886000,Inge Jonassen,Institutt for informatikk,Bergen
298845,Nordic PerMed: Novel wearable sensors and machine learning solutions for personalized diagnostics and treatment of sleep apnea,2019,2023,"Sleep apnea is a prevalent nocturnal breathing disorder and causes a high burden to the affected
individuals, as well as to society and economy. However, current diagnostic methods for sleep apnea are
complicated and labour-intensive processes involving various shortcomings related to measuring, analysing
and reporting of data. In this research project we introduce novel diagnostic approaches for sleep apnea
utilizing minimally sleep-disturbing wearable sensors and state-of-the art artificial intelligence and machine
learning solutions. This responds the growing pressure to move most sleep studies from sleep lab to home
and to reduce the workload and costs related to manual analysis of nocturnal sleep recordings. We aim to
develop new metrics which correlate better with the disease severity, related daytime symptoms and risk of
severe health consequences than the presently used diagnostic parameters. The project is based on large
international patient pools collected and analyzed in collaboration with world top level clinicians, physicists
and engineers in Norway, Iceland and Finland. By adapting modern artificial intelligence techniques, we can
identify such features from polysomnographic signals that could be used as novel biomarkers to personalize
sleep apnea subtypes and severity. The better understanding of sleep apnea subtypes and underlying
pathological mechanisms is crucial while developing personalized approaches to disease management. The
outcomes of this project can lead to paradigm shift in the diagnostics and treatment of sleep apnea and have
significant positive impact in Nordic health and socioeconomy. Wearable sleep monitoring systems and
sophisticated artificial intelligence based solutions could open global scalable business potential for industry

As a method for creating the AI models, we will use deep neural networks (DNNs) which are state of the art in image and video related analysis. The goal is to largely eliminate the rate of missed lesions in such examinations and thus increase the number of detected lesions, possibly preventing it from evolving into cancer. Our system is covering the whole pipeline, from extracting videos from the colonoscopy rack, through real-time detection and classification of lesions, to immediate feedback to the clinician. The intermediate feedback during the assessment of the patient is an important part of the project since it will allow the clinician to react immediately on the detected findings. To make sure the results of the analysis is relatable for all the involved disciplines, we will research and develop different ways to evaluate the results, this includes quantifying the effect in clinical trials.

The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control estimates that around 4 million patients are affected by HAIs every year, creating additional suffering, prolonged hospital stays, long-term disabilities and increasing the resistance to antimicrobials. For healthcare systems, the cost of HAIs is estimated at Euro 7 billion a year in directs costs, including almost 16 million extra days of hospitalization. Overall, additional costs to hospitals due to HAI can be estimated to be between Euro 6,000 and Euro 12,000 per case.
Resani Innovative Solution: The Resani Automatic Hand Sanitizer (AHS), sanitizes both hands simultaneously in less than 5 seconds and is coupled with a monitoring system for health-care-workers (HCWs), leveraging IoT technologies to encourage frequent use through a personalized badging system and user-friendly design. 
The AHS unit comprises an automatic antiseptic dispenser system which consists of atomising nozzles. Misting is initiated by a touch-free sensor.
Users wear a badge that is automatically detected and scanned each time they use the AHS. The AHS enables information to be uploaded to the Resani cloud. 
Using this information, the hospital is able to monitor hand hygiene protocol compliance of individual workers and collect real-time data to improve compliance procedures and efficiency of the devices.
A deep learning algorithm collects and analyses this information and updates each device accordingly. Resani couples the real-time monitoring with an App and an account for each HCW, that will issue targeted information (e.g. alarms for disinfection, time since last disinfection, reminders).",Næringsliv,Næringsliv,75000,Petter A.

E-NAV is a radical new evolution of our existing EU-funded sail planning platform and major improvement on current operations. It is the first system to fully leverage the latest wealth of satellite Earth Observation (EO) data coming from the European Copernicus and related programmes.

Real-time satellite, terrestrial, aircraft and maritime data feeds supply E-NAV with weather conditions and sea states 24/7. It seamlessly integrates this remote data with local information on vessel speed, roll, yaw, pitch, hull stress, energy use, local currents, waves and winds. It leverages historical patterns from archived Copernicus data and uses machine learning to progressively improve the modelling framework. Data is collected and processed at a dedicated onshore repository centre (ORC) to maximize computational capacity and link directly to off-shore fleet managers, public authorities and others.

The gap between predictions and real outcomes will gradually be reduced as E-NAV builds on crowd-sourced user data, self-improves and learns. E-NAV includes a training module with simulators and online gamification tools to teach navigators on the best-use of EO data for navigation. We improve the system by introducing newly available Copernicus data to the predictive process and develop training simulators for end users.

E-NAV will massively increase the quality and accuracy of sail forecasts on a global scale. A key project objective is to validate and demonstrate E-NAV on an internal test vessel and LAM and COL ships. We will thereby verify and extend our findings so far that E-NAV allows more efficient maritime journeys, already allowing 7% less fuel consumption, 90% accurate ETAs, 20% lower maintenance costs, and 15% longer ship service life.

are diagnosed with IHD, 700,000 live in the Nordic countries. IHD causes chest pain, myocardial infarcts, reduced physical capacity and reduces life-expectance.  IHD is not caused by a single mechanism but rather by a variety of different ones. Many risk factors and disease mechanisms are known, but we urgently need to manage complex data that can drive precise sub-classifications and risk stratification. At present, patients with IHD are generally diagnosed and treated using one-size-fits-all standard regimes. This leads to inefficient, costly, potentially harmful
over-management. At the same time, patients with high risk are not identified and treatment not
optimized. The objective is to develop and clinically implement personalized medicine (PM) with the dual purpose of avoiding both overtreatment as well as under-treatment in IHD.
In this Nordic interdisciplinary collaboration, we intend to establish and merge large Nordic cohorts with
well-described IHD genotypes and clinical expressions by combining existing and new data. The purpose is to
differentiate between different subgroups of IHD, and from the better characterization identify each patient's
cause of IHD. Using a machine learning approach, we will create a clinical integrative IHD algorithm, that will
aggregate the available data and in each diagnostic subgroup estimate the risk for future complications in
the individual patient. The data foundation will be routinely obtained clinical data, supplemented by data from
the Nordic national registries and biobanks,

Every year, 7 700 GWh of energy is lost in the transmission of electrical energy in Norway alone, at a cost of 2 B NOK. Energy losses also have a tremendous environmental impact, as the energy that is lost has the potential to power 48 000 Norwegian households. The landscape of energy production and distribution is rapidly changing - the rise of unregulated renewable energy, decentralized production, aging infrastructure and rapid digitization represents a paradigm shift. Utilities and energy companies need to embrace the opportunities presented by the vast amounts of data they produce. Sensero is creating data analytics solutions that turn this data into actionable information that engineers can use to make better decisions in the operation of the grid.

Second, we will systematically collect, map, and compare varying notions of algorithmic agency. Here, we will set a particular emphasis on the importance of a ‘co-constitution’ of algorithmic agency between organizations and stakeholders. Third, we will develop actionable guidance towards creating accountable algorithmic decision-making, based on both explainable programming and comprehensible communication of decision-making rationales and data sources. 

As a practical deliverable, we shall create a normative model for evaluating accountability in algorithmic decision-making processes, examining to what extent the algorithms are transparent, provide proper dispute channels, and enable public oversight.

Samtidig søker den etter å finne en sammenheng mellom samtlige variabler i datasettet, og på bakgrunn av dette skape en spesialisert beskrivelse av systemet som hensyntar all informasjon den er gitt.

Prosjektet skal predikere finansielle begivenheter ved bruk av kunstig intelligens. Finne tydelige trender som går igjen i store datamengder og bruke disse for å letter kunne predikere fremtiden opp til 3 år frem i tid.

Formålet med prosjektet er å utvikle en algoritme som reduserer arbeidsmengden og risikoen, samt øker presisjonen på bedriftsanalyse for til de gjeldende kundene. Utfordringene i prosjektet er innsamling, håndtering og prosessering av store datasett (big data), samt å utvikle en algoritme som klarer å skape en presis sammenheng mellom bedrifters finansregnskap, og hvordan disse bedriftene i fremtiden vil utvikle seg.

299585,Intelligent use of data to build optimization tools for cyber-physical systems in the process industry,2019,2022,"This project aims to address the main challenges related to developing optimization tools for the process industries, which are:
1. Lack of good models that can be used in optimization algorithms (offline model development)
2. Wrong value of model parameters used in the optimization problem (online model update)
3. Numerical robustness including computational issues

By leveraging big data and machine-learning algorithms, we can develop decision-support tools for complex cyber-physical systems that can be a part of the industrial internet-of-things. 

In this project, we will utilize process data to develop machine-learning based models (also known as digital-twins), that can be used for developing optimization tools. This will enable us to address the challenges with respect to developing models for optimization. Reinforcement learning approaches will also be used to operate the processes in new operating conditions other than the conditions used to train the model. 

To address the computational robustness issues of solving optimization problems, we also aim to approximate computationally intensive optimization problems using machine-learning algorithms. Instead of developing surrogate models that will be used in the optimizer, we plan to build surrogate optimizers or AI optimizers that approximate the numerical optimization solvers.

This project aims to restructure existing process industries by utilizing data more efficiently and  it will also open new industrial applications that could benefit from data-driven decision-support tools.  At the same time, this project will also develop novel algorithms for machine-learning-based optimization and thus move the research front and develop new subject areas in the field of online process optimization and autonomous decision-making. Therefore, this project will address challenges in the short to medium time horizon.",Universiteter,UoH-sektor,11362000,Sigurd Skogestad,Institutt for kjemisk prosessteknologi,Trondheim

299757,GentleMAN-Gentle and Advanced Robotic Manipulation of 3D Compliant Objects,2019,2023,"GentleMAN will result in a novel robot control and learning framework enabling real-world manipulation of 3D compliant objects. This framework will be based on visual and force/tactile sensing modalities and multi-modal learning models by careful balance and tighter integration between the components responsible for object localization and pose estimation, based on visual information, and the one responsible for manipulation based on the force/tactile information. The robotic manipulation of 3D compliant objects remains a key, yet relatively poorly-researched, field of study. Currently, most approaches to robotic manipulation focus on rigid objects. These are primarily vision-based and require a 3D model of the object or attempt to build one. The interaction of a robot with 3D compliant objects is one of the greatest challenges facing robotics today, due to complex aspects such as shape deformation during manipulation, and the need for real-time perception of deformation and the compliancy of the objects. To these are added coordination of the visual, force and tactile sensing required to control and accomplish specific manipulation tasks. These challenges become even more acute if the objects are slippery, made of soft tissue, or have irregular 3D shapes. Such objects are common in the agriculture, manufacturing, food, ocean space, health and other sectors in both industrial and non-industrial settings. The GentleMAN addresses these challenges by focusing on providing robots with advanced manipulation skills that reproduce human-like movements and fine motor skills. Robots will thus learn intelligently how to induce and apply the necessary manipulative forces while generating occlusion-resilient vision control, real-time 3D deformation tracking and a shape-servoing strategy. A highly qualified and expert interdisciplinary consortium, consisting of SINTEF, NTNU, NMBU, INRIA, MIT and QUT has been assembled to conduct the proposed research.",Teknisk-industrielle institutter,Instituttsektor,16000000,Ekrem Misimi,SINTEF OCEAN AS,Trondheim
299827,Enabling Future Dependable Ubiquitous Services and Data with Novel Testing Methods for Quantum Programs,2019,2024,"Quantum computing (QC) promises to revolutionize the present form of computing, by solving unimaginably large and highly complex problems that traditional computers would never crack. The potential for QC to solve highly complex problems is also reflected by the rising number of QC platforms (e.g., Microsoft Quantum computing, IBM Quantum Experience) and their supported programming languages (e.g., Q#, QisKit supports Python, Javascript, etc). The rise of QC platforms, software development kits, and programming languages is an essential step towards Ubiquitous Quantum Computing. However, there is an urgent need for testing quantum programs, which has shown to be challenging due to inherent differences of QC with its classical counterpart, including its probabilistic nature and un-observability of the execution. Thus far, there are no systematic methods, tools, and frameworks for the proper testing of QC programs written in quantum high-level programming languages (e.g., Q#).

The ambition of the Qu-Test is to develop radically new methods for automated and systematic testing of quantum programs, based on a rigorous theoretical foundation with the ultimate goal of supporting future ubiquitous services and data related to QC applications to guarantee their dependability. To allow for testing complex quantum programs with a minimal amount of QC resources, we will also propose novel quantum optimization algorithms. The research agenda of this proposal is three-fold: 1) building testing foundations for quantum programming languages, 2) building a novel quantum search algorithmic framework for test optimization, and 3) developing an experimental testing framework including test execution, involving testing quantum programs with the proposed foundations and optimization algorithms. Our frameworks will be implemented in Q# and QisKit and we will demonstrate cost-effective testing of quantum programs written in Q# and the languages supported by QisKit (e.g., Python).",Øvrige forskningsinstitutter,Instituttsektor,14445000,Shaukat Ali,SIMULA RESEARCH LABORATORY AS,Bærum

Hence, to develop environmental friendly technologies,aka Green Technologies,opportunities needs to be explored & utilized with the help of IoT open data, Big Data Analytics,& AI.   
For this to happen,Ocean,Marine & Energy companies need to participate in the open-data initiatives and utilize the open data from IoT devices,sensors,5G,RFID,&NFC devices.By participating in one such initiative will enable Big Data Analytics & allow for the creation of new solutions using Machine Learning algorithms & other AI algorithms. However,to reach up to this stage of developing new solutions,several challenges need to be tackled.The first challenge the enterprises face is the interoperability of different systems & the different format & schema of the open data available from the IoT devices. It is because many of the systems are proprietary, and have their own communication protocols, and data formats. Once, the interoperability issue is removed, the second challenge is to apply Big Data Analytics tools to explore trends and opportunities that have real environmental & business value and can be exploited. The final challenge is to develop new AI algorithms, and innovative business models that can exploit the opportunities explored and develop a new market of Green Technologies at the cross-sector of Marine, Ocean, and Energy companies.

Falling capital costs (CAPEX) increase focus on the long term operational and maintenance (O&M) costs. Many turbines operate outside their original warranty period putting the maintenance costs on the wind farm operator rather than the turbine manufacturer. 
Turbine blades represent a large proportion (22% of the overall turbine cost. Today there is no means of direct inspection of the internal structure of turbine blades. The worldwide failure rate for all wind turbine blades is annually ca. 0.5% accounting for 3,800 annual failures. Lack of inspection data hinder the effectiveness of analytics.
The RADBLAD 3 project address O&M costs of offshore wind turbines and demonstrate the large impact of robotics to in-field wind turbine blade inspection. A robotic platform will be developed and demonstrated for enabling the process of blade structural inspection. The robot will climb the tower with an extendable arm with the X-Ray Radiography system to inspect the turbine blades.  This will enable imaging of the internal structure of the blade to investigate damage and defects. Trials will demonstrate the robotic platform in realistic conditions, and will introduce a new, complementary flow of data and analysis to current methodology.

Maskinlæring kan radikalt forbedre måten bedriftene behandler det massive volumet av dokumenter i sine organisasjoner. Maskinlæring refererer til et felt av datavitenskap som gjør at datamaskiner kan ""lære"" uten å bli programmert. Teknologien skal kunne analysere dokumentstruktur og innhold for å klassifisere dokumenter i henhold til felles likheter og egenskaper. For eksempel kan maskinlæringsverktøyene oppdage dokumenttyper ved å
identifisere åpenbar terminologi. Etter hvert som maskinlærings teknologien forbedres, vil dokumentinnspillingsprogramvaren få muligheten til å ""lese"" og forstå friformet tekst ved å inkorporere naturlig språkbehandling (NLP). NLP gjør det mulig for datamaskiner å forstå og tolke menneskers språk, slik at dokumenter kan behandles med begrenset manuell innblanding.

Our results will be applied to risk management and reliability analysis with a focus on environmental variables as risk factors and models related to climate. The project consists of 4 scientific work packages:

WP1 - Reinforcement learning and stochastic optimal control:
We investigate whether it is possible to use the ideas and theoretical results from the stochastic maximum principle in connection with reinforcement learning. Can we draw inspiration from the martingale methods and the maximum principle theory of stochastic optimal control to relax the Markovian assumption of reinforcement learning? We will compare ML methods for stochastic optimal control problems (e.g., reinforcement learning and deep neural networks) to classical dynamic programming techniques.

WP2 - Constrained risk management and connections to machine learning:
We study an optimal consumption problem with a weighted value at risk constraint (WVaR) as well as other kinds of trading constraints (for instance no shortselling). We would also like to include the WVaR concept when doing risk analysis of stochastic networks.

WP3 - Stochastic process modeling of degradation caused by environmental risk factors:
We use self-exciting processes with positive jumps to model degradation caused by sporadic shocks with clustering behaviour. We will study the limiting process when the jump intensity increases at the same time as jump size decreases and compare this to the gamma process and the inverse Gaussian process. We also study optimal maintenance.

WP4 - Augmented environmental contours:
We extend environmental contours with the hope of contributing to better safety assessments of structures exposed to environmental risk factors. In particular, we study design optimisation with buffering and see how WVaR can be included in the environmental contour framework.

This will contribute to preserving Norways' democratic values and the high levels of trust it enjoys from citizens, in the scramble to realise a data-driven public sector.

This will be realized by
• establishing an overview and baseline for AI adoption in the Norwegian public sector. 
• testing whether the risks and challenges already identified in current research are also relevant to the Norwegian context and identify if there are others which should be considered.
• going beyond a general public sector assessment by taking three case studies, to investigate if there is a difference in the perceived risks and challenges depending on the level of access to data and competence within the public sector or whether the private sector is involved.
• identifying the most pressing issues and gaps in governance of AI deployment in the Norwegain context.  This should also be transferable to the Nordic and broader international context.
• identifying, critically evaluating and recommending potential remedies, including both soft and hard law tools.

A multi-disciplinary approach will be taken, concentrating primarily on the legal, ethical and social challenges emerging in the adoption of this technology within the public sector. Research will be performed empirically and is inspired by critical data and algorithm studies.  

The project will begin by establishing the status within the public sector. It will take three case studies, namely a data & competence rich organization, a data & competence poor organization and a public-private partnership, to ascertain if risks and challenges differ depending upon the environment within which AI is deployed.

The project is highly relevant and of great benefit to society. Accurate and efficient tools for diagnosis are essential in order to facilitate intestinal screening and monitoring programs for large parts of the population that seek to  detect diseases at an early stage and thereby prevent severe  diseases from developing. 

The project is divided into three work packages. The first focuses on developing more accurate and efficient automatic pathology detection algorithms than state-of-the art methods. These will also be compared to the performance of trained gastroenterologists.   The second work package focuses on constructing 3D models based on wireless capsule endoscopy images that will help gastroenterologists more easily detect pathologies in the intestinal wall.   The third work package is dedicated to the combination of automatic pathology detection and 3D reconstruction. The goal is twofold: i) automatically construct 3D model based on pathology detection algorithms predictions for enhanced viewing by gastroenterologists.  ii) Improve automatic pathology detection using 3D data as input. 

The project includes one national (Innlandet Hospital) and three international partners (University of Thessaly, Sheffield Teaching Hospitals and Max Planck Institute for Informatics), whom of each is renowned in their field and highly capable of bringing complementary skills.

300034,Data-driven Framework for Personalised Cancer Screening,2019,2023,"Cancer is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, but a large proportion of the incidents are preventable. For example, mass-screening Nordic programs of cervical cancer have a proven strong effect for preventing cancer at the population level and have produced large amounts of individual and clinical data, centrally organised at nationwide registries. Despite this success, minimising over- and under-treatment, and, thus, reducing expenditure, remains a major challenge.

Existing automatic decision support systems for cervical cancer prevention are, however, extremely conservative as they are mostly limited to identifying patients who are overdue for their next routine screening. Current knowledge about the cancer, together with a wealth of available data and modern technologies, can offer far better personalised prevention.

DeCipher aims to develop a data-driven framework to provide a personalised time-varying risk assessment for cancer initiation and identify subgroups of individuals and biomarkers leading to similar disease progression. By unveiling structure hidden in the data via randomisation and probabilistic tools, we will develop novel theoretically grounded machine learning methods for analysis of temporal, sparse, and multimodal data.

DeCipher consists of an excellent multidisciplinary research team from diverse fields such as machine learning, data mining, screening programs, and epidemiology. Leveraging Nordic screening programs and data, the project will enable better and more accurate cancer screening. Our foundational and algorithmic progress will also enable integration of data-driven techniques into biomedical domain, thus corresponding to the Medium-term Time Horizon objectives.

The project addresses privacy and security related problems from a physical-layer perspective where traditional methods fail to detect security breaches and privacy invasions. The considered problems are particularly challenging due to the distributed nature of CPS/IoT, dynamic and non-stationary nature of attacks, and infrastructure constraints. The existing data security approaches ignore the additional information available at the physical layer such as sensor redundancy, control laws, and physical processes. Leveraging on the model knowledge and side information, the project adopts a secure-by-design philosophy for designing CPS and IoT with security and privacy as an inherent aspect of the functionality without solely depending on additional mechanisms at a later part of the design. Unlike the current approaches that assume security and privacy as an additional feature of the system, it is here consider to be a fundamental design constraint. This ensures that CPS and IoT function even when other security protocols fail and maintain operations under adversarial conditions. Finally, the project aims to strengthen the existing liaisons between academia and industry (NTNU and SINTEF), foster international scientific and education collaboration to educate and inform a new generation of scientists and engineers in the strategic area of IoT technologies.

Within 10 years of onset, 75 percent of diabetics will have some degree of DR. However, vision loss due to diabetic retinopathy is preventable with early detection and intervention. Early detection of DR in mild and moderate stages of the disease through eye examination, can reduce the risk of blindness by 95%. If treated early, the procedures are inexpensive and uncomplicated.

The gold standard of diagnosing DR is expensive and often unavailable in remote or developing parts of the world.

300172,Safe Reinforcement Learning using Model Predictive Control,2019,2024,"AI is increasingly deployed in the industry. It is currently used for applications where decisions are not safety-critical or where human operators can vet the decisions before their deployment. Industries dealing with cyber-physical systems evolving in complex environments could substantially benefit from AI tools that can learn to improve the decisions process using data collected in the past.

High-tech companies commonly use Model Predictive Control (MPC) to deal with control and decision problems involving safety requirements, and have started using AI tools for cyber-physical systems at the Research and Development level. Reinforcement Learning (RL), a subfield of AI capable of learning to take optimal decisions for cyber-physical systems, is a very common choice. Unfortunately, deploying RL is problematic whenever safety requirements and liabilities are at stake. Industries want to understand and have safety certificates on the automated decisions driving their products, and this is difficult to obtain for existing RL methods. Hence deploying RL tools in systems involving safety requirements is currently a major difficulty. Some companies involved in Autonomous Driving use ad hoc heuristics to deal with the problem, but a genuine solution is still missing.

This project will merge theoretical results from RL with advanced, formal control methods resulting from the field of MPC to create a novel form of AI for cyber-physical systems where the decisions can be explained and certified for safety. Performing the research proposed in this project requires a unique combination of in-depth knowledge both in RL and MPC, which few groups possess. NTNU is currently in a great position to carry this research forward. The project will be integrated within the AMOS center and the Open AI Lab at NTNU, which offer unique expertize in the field of safety for autonomous systems and AI.

300305,SciML - Scientific Computing & Machine Learning,2019,2023,"Partial differential equations (PDEs) have been studied for centuries and have seen an impressive utilization in scientific computing (SC) during the last sixty years due to increasingly powerful computers. Alongside with the utilization, a powerful theoretical foundation has been developed and this foundation ensures both efficient computations and accurate results. In the last ten years, an explosion of usage of machine learning (ML) techniques in the form of deep neural networks (DNNs) have demonstrated a wide range of successes due to both high-performance computing and vast amounts of available data. Despite the similarities between the different areas, the synergies effects have so far been sparse, in particular on the theoretical level. This proposal aims to bridge the gap between these areas. The project addresses challenges on the long-term horizon in the IKTPluss program.

There are three crucial developments in the theory of computational methods for PDEs that should be merged with DNN. The first is the development of more reliable and robust machine learning techniques by exploiting multigrid (MG) techniques developed for the solution of PDEs. The second is the integration of DNNs into a MG framework. And the third topic concerns the integration of DNNs and FEM to enable learning of computational models. These theoretical developments should be accompanied with software development and relevant applications. Here, applications in biology and medicine are of particular importance because the underlying principles are often not well understood. In particular, we will investigate a novel mechanism related to Alzheimer´s disease in which the PI is on the forefront of current research.",Øvrige forskningsinstitutter,Instituttsektor,15987000,Kent-Andre Mardal,SIMULA RESEARCH LABORATORY AS,Bærum

(MyData – Interoperability – Data Security – PROMs and PREMs – Quality of life)

The key to health system transformation lies in turning wellness into a system where the individual, instead of care providers, is at the core. This means encouraging individuals to adopt an active role in their own care, and giving them the needed tools to track their health and control their own wellbeing data. Empowering individuals with knowledge and control over their own health effectively engages them in their own care. In addition to giving individuals the tools to access and share their own medical data, wellbeing data produced by the individuals themselves assumes an increasing role. New technologies such as wearable devices can be used by individuals to monitor their own health and to get real-time feedback about health related issues. The detailed data captured by these technologies can also be shared with care providers to deliver better diagnosis, personalized and timely care. Moreover, technologies can be used by individuals not only to access their own wellbeing data, but also to access each other. Especially those with chronic and rare conditions benefit from technologies that facilitate peer-to-peer support networks and help supplement information obtained from care providers with peer advice and knowledge.

MyData principles for personal information

The requirements of both human-centricity and data interoperability can be addressed by MyData infrastructure and approach. MyData approaches personal data as a valuable resource and is essentially a model for managing and processing personal information with the individuals being in control of the data collected about them. At minimum this would mean the individual’s right to obtain and freely use his/her personal information. MyData architecture aims to enable the flow of personal data from multiple data sources to multiple services via a standardized, interoperable consent management framework.",Øvrige andre,Øvrige,400000,Gupta D.B.R.K.

300435,Emergent networks: Predicting strain localization and fracture network development,2020,2024,"Our experimental time series of fracture networks and strain fields provide unique access to coalescing fractures and localizing strain at spatiotemporal resolutions previously unavailable. This access enables quantifying the dynamics of the transition from distributed to localized deformation. The geophysical community lacks a quantitative understanding of the criteria that govern the transition from distributed to localized deformation. To address this gap, we will apply spatial clustering statistics, machine learning, and numerical modeling.

The spatial clustering results will quantify the localization process with clear, concise, and quantifiable metrics, and thereby provide a unifying framework to describe the localization process that leads to macroscopic failure. This analysis aims to determine if the clustering statistics of fracture and/or strain networks predicts the time to macroscopic failure.
The machine learning analyses will predict the volume by which a fracture grows, magnitude of strain localization, and time to macroscopic failure. These analyses aim to isolate the criteria that govern fracture propagation and coalescence, and strain localization. Determining the factors that exert the greatest impact on fault network evolution may help focus seismic hazard assessments of natural fault systems. 

The numerical modelling analyses will help determine if the conclusions gleaned from the cm-scale experimental clustering and machine learning applications apply to km-scales and seismogenic depths, and will enable visualizing the evolving stress field. Comparison of the accuracy of the machine learning predictions that do and do not use information about the stress field will quantify the importance of characterizing this parameter. This quantification could help justify the cost of field measurements of the stress field in seismically active areas, or indicate that the stress field is not critical to characterize when predicting fault interaction.",Universiteter,UoH-sektor,7583000,Jessica McBeck,NJORD,Oslo
300461,Adaptive Immunity for Software: Making Systems and Services Autonomously Self-Healing,2019,2024,"Software has become a central part of nearly all sectors of economic activity, and our daily lives have become increasingly dependent on complex software-intensive systems and services. Failures in these systems can affect thousands or even millions of people and lead to massive damages.

Despite significant investments in software verification and validation (V&V), the software industry is still plagued by failures. One reason is that conventional V&V can only target anticipated faults: it can only check that the conditions corresponding to known or expected problems do not occur. However, the complexity of modern software makes it impossible to anticipate all problems that could be encountered. 

The overall goal of this project is to devise novel methods and techniques to create self-healing software-intensive systems, i.e. systems that support autonomous detection, diagnosis, and containment of unanticipated faults during execution, thereby significantly increasing their dependability, robustness, and resilience. 

We reach this goal by building on the concept of an artificial immune system to achieve three scientific break-throughs: 
(1) Autonomic techniques that can detect unanticipated faults by distinguishing between normal behavior and anomalies in runtime observational data.
(2) Adaptive learning techniques that make it easier to recognize faults that are similar to the ones that have seen before.
(3) Cost-effective techniques to diagnose the root causes of a fault and to contain its impact, both inside and outside the system.

Timeliness: Recent advances in machine learning together with the PI's new results on automatically learning patterns in high volume data and generalizing them using rule aggregation [23 in project description] make that now is the best time to start this research. These failures need to be addressed, and the global state-of-the-art was not at the required level to start this ambitious research undertaking until just recently.",Øvrige forskningsinstitutter,Instituttsektor,15999000,Leon Moonen,SIMULA RESEARCH LABORATORY AS,Bærum
300504,Bio-inspired neural networks for AI applications,2019,2024,"There has been an enormous development in artificial intelligence (AI) recently. However, while AI supersedes human skills in some fields, the brain is still far superior in many areas - it is more energy efficient, it needs fewer examples to learn, it can learn complex tasks easier, and it can transfer knowledge from one task to another. Recent progress has come in reinforcement learning and deep learning, which in principle are inspired by neurological processes, but in practice there are large differences between the way artificial and biological neural networks work. Our hypothesis is that artificial neural networks based on the structure, dynamics and learning rules in the brain will be significantly more effective than current models. We will transfer recent knowledge from neuroscience to develop new machine learning methods that open for new scientific and technological developments. We will address (i) how representations in biological networks can improve artificial network models, transfer and unsupervised learning models, (ii) how to develop and apply effective learning rules in biologically inspired neural networks, (iii) and how spiking neural networks can define a new model for artificial networks and processing, (iv) and develop a synergetic model that incorporates these features. To address these challenges, we have organized a cross-disciplinary team of leading experts in neurophysiology, machine learning, statistical physics, and computational science. We have experience in building and supervising cross-disciplinary breakthrough research, and have a broad international network of collaborators spanning neurophysiology, psychology, computational neuroscience and AI. This puts us in an excellent position to develop biologically inspired machine learning methods for the future, and to educate the next generation of interdisciplinary researchers and technologists that will develop the next generation of AI science and applications.",Universiteter,UoH-sektor,15998000,Anders Malthe-Sørenssen,Fysisk institutt,Oslo

We will develop the methodological groundwork for an Optimization-based Traffic Management System (OTMS) that integrates state-of-the-art optimization algorithms and advanced forecasting techniques to tackle the complex scenarios of train dispatching that are found in Norway and the rest of Europe. Expected benefits include improved punctuality, reduced workload for dispatchers, and more efficient utilization of the existing infrastructure. The outcome of this project will be a prototype tool that will be tested in the greater Oslo area. Clearly, all developments for the greater Oslo area can be easily extended to any other railway region found in Norway. Dispatchers at the Oslo control center will be able to visualize the effects of each decision they make, up to few hours in the future. More importantly, the OTMS will automatically suggest them a set of optimized dispatching decisions based on the current train positions and preferences. All in real-time. In addition, we intend to investigate a novel methodology that exploits information gathered by the optimization algorithm of the OTMS with the purpose of identifying bottlenecks in the rail network. This will help steer future investment decisions in infrastructure enhancements.
The project will last 3 years, and it will involve three main actors: SINTEF as the project owner and research partner, Bane NOR as the industrial partner and NSB as an end-user (train operator). SINTEF will contribute with its extensive expertise and outstanding research in optimization, machine learning, and train dispatching, in particular.

300567,Grasision: Actionable Intelligence Tool for Sustainable Grassland Production,2019,2020,"Precision agriculture has changed the way farmers manage their business, with the use of various technologies, such as drones for scouting fields and aerial imagery, and artificial intelligence and robotics. However, development of image analysis tools for classification and precise estimation of plant features is extremely challenging, especially on grassland canopies. While available tools are mostly effective on row- and horticultural crops, analyzing the highly complex vegetation environment of grass swards, including leaves overlap, is a problem yet to be solved.

Farmers require recommendations to cope with production and climate challenges, while improving sustainability and protecting the environment. Consequently, a growing demand for “actionable intelligence” is visible among grassland producers. To address this need, a new image analysis tool (i.e., solution), Grasision, is being developed at NIBIO, to estimate key indicators of sward quality status, namely plant and bare soil coverages and leaf area index -none of which is supported by existing solutions. Our tool will provide farmers with critical input to take cost-effective and responsible measures for fertilization, sward renovation and harvesting. Grasision results from devising a new image analysis and classification algorithm, using machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques, to automatically process color images acquired via on-ground platforms or drones. 

The main objective of this project is to improve the tool’s segmentation and classification accuracy, by refining the algorithm with new training data and ground-truth samples taken on new grass fields. Moreover, we will develop the software platform, and work actively to secure applicable IP rights and industrial partnerships. Additionally, this project sets the foundation for a subsequent funding application for a commercialization project, while supporting NIBIO's ongoing research on precision agriculture and forage production.",Næringsliv,Næringsliv,500000,Izaskun Muruzábal-Lecumberri,VALIDÉ AS,Stavanger

Planning for and mitigating these impacts requires detailed knowledge of the extreme winds and their relation to damage. The project aims to increase understanding of how windstorms and damage is related and incorporate this knowledge in a useful way for impact and adaptation purposes through the development of detailed return values for extreme winds and storm-damage functions using four decades of nationwide insurance data on municipality level.  
The project will further quantify possible changes in extreme winds due to future climate change and their uncertainty by analyzing an ensemble of regional climate models and link the results to the developed storm-damage functions.  Future changes in exposure will be addressed through national demographic scenarios and the benefit of reducing the vulnerability by assuming that building standards are strengthen to prevent losses for winds below a certain return period will be conducted.

300740,Digital design of  antibodies,2020,2024,"Antibodies are key molecules of our immune system and fight infections with exquisite specificity. As such, antibodies are natural therapeutics. In fact, so-called monoclonal antibodies are the fastest growing class of biological drugs and have revolutionized the treatment of human diseases. However, current platforms for design and selection of monoclonal antibodies are essentially stochastic, expensive and time-consuming. Therefore, there is an urgent need for more innovative and sophisticated strategies for designing the next-generation of tailored antibodies.     
Two major desirable features of therapeutic antibodies are: (1) long plasma half-life and (2) fine-tuned target specificity. Recent data have revealed surprisingly large differences in plasma half-life of such antibodies. The reasons for this, however, remain poorly understood, but are clearly related to the antibody variable region. In addition, our preliminary data suggest that antibodies binding the same target vary widely in their sequence composition. How specificity is encoded into the antibody variable region remains equally unclear. Thus, in order to digitize antibody discovery, there is a need to gain a comprehensive understanding of how antibody variable region sequences affect antigen binding and half-life, and hence therapeutic outcome. In this transdisciplinary project, we aim to develop a digital antibody discovery platform (DigiAb) that will allow machine-learning-driven computational selection and design of antibodies with both favorable target specificity and superior plasma half-life. This will be achieved by combining state-of-the-art biochemical methodology with computational modeling of single-cell antibody sequencing datasets in an academic-industry collaboration. Our project will reveal new principles in antibody biology and machine-learning for antibody discovery, which will pave the way for rule-driven fast and effortless digital design of tailored therapeutic antibodies.",Universiteter,UoH-sektor,9976000,Victor Greiff,Institutt for klinisk medisin,Oslo
300921,Graph-based Neural Models for Dialogue Management,2020,2024,"The GraphDial project sets out to advance the state-of-the-art in dialogue management. Current approaches to dialogue management often make use of neural models trained on dialogue data using supervised or reinforcement learning. These approaches have led to enhanced performance across a broad range of tasks, but also have two important shortcomings:
(1) They rely on quite restrictive representations of the dialogue state (often based on fixed numbers of slots to fill);
(2) They are dependent on large amounts of training data to learn the model parameters.

The project will investigate an alternative approach to dialogue management based on the use of probabilistic graphs as core representation for the dialogue state. Graphs are well suited to capture rich interaction contexts including multiple entities and relations. They also facilitate the use of relational abstractions covering large portions of the state space in a compact and human-readable manner. 

Another central topic for the project is the use of weak supervision to train neural models for dialogue state tracking and action selection. Weak supervision allows machine learning models to be trained with indirect data extracted from noisy labelling functions or domain knowledge. The use of weak supervision is particularly attractive for dialogue management due to the difficulty of obtaining annotated data in most dialogue domains. The project intends to integrate a range of weak supervision signals, including user responses to grounding or clarification acts, heuristic rules and global constraints on the graph structure. 

To achieve these objectives, GraphDial will feature collaborations with leading researchers in the field of spoken dialogue systems, statistical relational learning, graph neural networks and human-robot interaction.

300955,Redesigning the Dividend Withholding Tax & Closing the Loopholes,2020,2024,"In October 2018 a cooperation between European journalists known as CORRECTIV uncovered the largest ever European tax fraud in the cum-ex files. Cum-ex, and related strategies known as cum-cum and cum-fake (henceforth cum-schemes) are schemes that allow investors to avoid paying the dividend-withholding tax (DWT), or to receive excessive tax reimbursements. The revenue loss in Europe is not yet known, but estimates suggest the damage exceeds €100 billion. Despite diligent reporting by journalists, there remain many gaps in our knowledge that can best be answered by academic economists trained in econometrics and optimal taxation. TAXLOOP will collect and analyze a financial and regulatory database for at least 17 European countries that gives an overview of the current state of DWT. We will use the data to find out which countries have been affected by the fraud and how much revenue is lost. TAXLOOP will also provide policy advice on how to design the DWT to make it more robust against tax avoidance. Finally, we will take a step back and reevaluate what role the DWT should play in the overall tax system. The tools we use in our analysis are econometrics, machine learning and optimal taxation. TAXLOOP will contribute to existing knowledge by being the first to provide a European-wide analysis of the impact of the cum-schemes, and by empirically evaluating the regulations that make a country vulnerable to them. We also provide the first optimal DWT-model that will allow policy makers to better design their DWT.",Vitenskapelige høyskoler,UoH-sektor,7678000,Floris Tobias Zoutman,Institutt for foretaksøkonomi,Bergen
300989,Multiparameter Active Antenna Sensor,2020,2023,"With the expansion of the internet-of-things (IoT) in various sectors, the number of connected devices is expected to reach 75 billion by 2025. One of the main use-cases of such devices is to sense one or more physical parameters for monitoring and/or actuation purposes. The rapid expansion and massive deployment of these devices rise the need for new design consideration to support its future sustainability in terms of hardware use and power consumption. Triggered by this, the MAAS project explores the revolutionary secondary use of the sensor node antenna for multiparameter active sensing purposes using sensitive sensing materials deployed on the antenna surface. This eliminates the conventional use of the sensor integrated circuits (ICs) and microcontrollers, and their associated power consumption. The idea is to move the complexity from the sensor node to the computation of the gateway station, where signal processing and machine learning techniques are employed to remotely sense the physical parameters. This is done by detecting changes on the radiation characteristics of the antenna sensor caused by the applied sensing materials. The idea of using the antenna as a multiparameter active sensor is an absolute novelty. If successful, it will reduce the hardware use of a standard sensor node by at least 50% (i.e. no sensor ICs, sampler and processor, and memory will be needed along with their associated power consumption), resulting in more than doubling their battery lifetime. Strategically, the project will strengthen the research-based professional educations and practices within electronics to meet the current and future needs of experts with the new knowledge and the innovation that the project brings. The ambition is to create a new generation of IoT devices that use the antenna not only for radiating electromagnetic waves, but also has a secondary functionality of actively sensing multiple physical parameters (without using sensor ICs and a microprocessor).",Universiteter,UoH-sektor,9863000,Michael Cheffena,NORGES TEKNISK-NATURVITENSKAPELIGE UNIVERSITET NTNU,Trondheim

The rate limiting enzyme of carbon dioxide assimilation is called RubisCO, which is remarkably slow and inefficient, wasting huge amounts of the energy harvested from the sun. COOFIX aims to design a novel enzyme that can fix carbon dioxide into the metabolic intermediate oxalate in a single step.

COOFIX employ a highly interdisciplinary approach, combining biochemistry, spectroscopy, structural biology and computational chemistry in an innovative manner to accomplish the project objectives. Binuclear organometallic copper complexes are capable of reducing carbon dioxide to oxalate with high selectivity, and this functionality will be engineered in type-3 copper protein active sites. An autotrophic model organism will be engineered to accommodate our novel carbon dioxide reductase and to convert the enzyme product oxalate to biomass.

A novel method of computer assisted enzyme engineering is proposed to efficiently improve our carbon dioxide reducing enzyme. Current computational engineering methods are limited by inefficient sampling of fluctuating protein structures along the evolutionary path. COOFIX combine hardware and software accelerated molecular dynamics simulations with machine learning to address this challenge.

301317,Mapping of Algae and Seagrass using Spectral Imaging and Machine Learning,2020,2024,"Seagrass meadows and kelp forests are two of the most important marine habitats along the Norwegian coast. These are exposed to stressors such as eutrophication, ocean warming and ocean darkening, which all impact their distribution and health. At present, mapping of these species in Norway is done at a small number of sampling points using underwater “drop cameras”, recording coverage or state parameters of the species at points or along line transects.  There is a need for cost efficient tools to map and monitor the distribution and ecological state of blue forests over larger areas and extended time periods. Large-scale mapping based on imaging from satellites or airplanes is possible, but has several drawbacks: Satellites have limited spatial resolution and depend on cloudless days, and airplane missions are costly. We propose using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with hyperspectral cameras for mapping medium-sized areas. UAVs enable flexible, low-cost imaging missions with high spatial resolution, and hyperspectral imaging will provides detailed spectral information within each pixel. The spectrum of light reflected from underwater vegetation and the seafloor can be used as a “spectral fingerprint” to estimate parameters such as plant coverage, species, biomass and physiological state. Scuba divers, drop cameras and ROVs will be used to aquire “ground truth” measurement of these parameters, and machine learning methods will be used to train mathematical models relating the hyperspectral data to the field measurements. This enables estimation of biophysical parameters for each image pixel. Through statistical analysis of the mapped spatial and temporal changes, we will identify the main drivers that cause the observed patterns. Understanding how the structure and function of these species varies across environmental gradients is essential knowledge for sustainable coastal management.",Universiteter,UoH-sektor,7995000,Martin Skjelvareid,Institutt for datateknologi og beregningsorienterte ingeniørfag,Tromsø
301718,Searching for Dark Matter with Light,2020,2024,"According to modern cosmological models only 16% of all matter in our universe corresponds to the known, visible matter. The other 84% is called dark matter (DM) and could so far only be observed indirectly. This is why its particle nature is poorly understood. Yet, DM played a crucial role during the evolution of our universe and thus the formation of life itself. Therefore, the understanding of DM is an important aim of contemporary physics and is pursued in this project.

With this research proposal, we will endeavor to uncover the particle nature of DM by analysing the first data taken with the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA). This observatory for gamma-ray astronomy is soon entering its construction phase and will outperform current telescopes by far. This leap in sensitivity can be the decisive factor to unravel the nature of DM. Therefore, now is the time to contribute to those efforts as this allows for enough time to prepare the recording of the data as well as their analysis. 

Project group members will engage both in the commissioning and operation of CTA and in the analysis of the first data. We will strive to improve on current analyses by refining the background estimation and by using modern machine learning algorithms. The work will be fully integrated in the Norwegian efforts to search for DM and within the CTA community. It will help the project manager to advance her career as an independent researcher and include several measures to communicate the results to the different target audiences.

301883,Criminal exposure in vulnerable areas,2020,2025,"The overall aim of this project is to establish a thorough knowledgebase on the nationwide prevalence and development of concentration of multiple social problems in neighbourhoods, these areas' development and consequences for the inhabitants. A particular focus is on crime, and the concentrations of social problems combined with the presence of informal networks of offenders (or even more organized gangs) are often referred to as 'vulnerable areas', with the potential for developing even more serious social problems, related to sub-cultures of social excluded groups.  We will analyse the dynamics of individuals' criminal careers (wp1), co-offending networks (wp2), how they are geographically connected, and the ways these networks affect and are affected by social neighbourhoods (wp3). 
The results from the project are expected to be directly informative for policy regarding urban development and area-based initiatives. The results will also be informative for the police by providing both analyses of crime patterns, offenders and networks, as well as putting these into local geographical context. 
This project will make use of standard Norwegian registerdata, but expanding by making use of less used police data with additional details and also utilizing less commonly used information on social ties and geographical locations. This will entails combining statistical techniques for panel data, social network analyses, geographical information system, and machine learning. Before data are collected, key analyses will be pre-registered at osf.io and updated with full code and documentation. We regard this as important part of method development in register-based social science by ensuring transparency and reproducibility, although the current system for access to register data poses particular challenges for exact reproducibility.

302203,Algorithms and Models for Socially Beneficial Artificial Intelligence,2020,2025,"Artificially intelligent (AI) systems are playing an ever increasing role in society. To ensure that they are beneficial, we must guarantee that they act not only according to the designer's intentions, but also in a way that is fair to all individuals and groups affected by their decisions.

Many applications integrate human and AI decisions, such as crowdsourcing, recommendation systems, navigation and autonomous vehicles, as well as decision support systems for credit risk and criminal recidivism. AI systems are also deployed in semi-automated design tools, and diagnostics in medicine. Humans interact with a pre-designed AI, which may by unaware of the motivations, behaviour or knowledge of people. When such an AI is used at scale, it must take into account broader, societal considerations, such as fairness and privacy.

Our project will investigate the relationship between humans and AI in society. We will create algorithms for automatically aligning AI behaviour with societal values. This involves learning about human preferences and behaviour, and using this information so as to take both into account. Our work will be grounded on technical advances in reinforcement learning, mechanism design, differential privacy, and the emerging field of algorithmic fairness. A novel aspect of our proposal are informational notions of fairness, where the decision maker must consider feedback effects, and our explicit handling of human biases.

The project will be implemented by the PI, one postdocotral researcher and two PhD students, in collaboration with researchers abroad. The latter will be enhanced through visiting researcher grants of 1-2 months per year.

302506,Domain Walls as Oxide Synapses for Neuromorphic Circuitry,2020,2024,"The OXYNAPSE project aims to develop functionality in inorganic oxides to mimic the fast, energy-conserving and highly flexible human brain. Ferroelectric domain walls will be developed as artificial synapses which can act as enabling building blocks for neuromorphic circuitry. Biological learning will be replicated by training domain walls with electrical stimuli, emulating the transfer of electrical signals between neurons in the brain. Domain walls can in principle be made smaller and faster, and potentially more energy-efficient, than biological synapses.
With the ever-increasing demand for computing, the energy-consumption form computers, portable electronics and the internet increases at a rate which soon will become unsustainable. To impede global warming, it is essential to limit our global energy consumption, and a paradigm shift is needed for more energy-efficient computer architecture and neuromorphic circuitry is among the most promising vistas of opportunity. 
Domain walls have advantages compared to traditional concepts for artificial synapses by being movable, erasable and rewritable. In contrast with traditional semiconductors, the properties of transition metal oxides can be tuned by exchanging oxygen with the surrounding atmosphere, in principle allowing reconfiguration of circuitry and devices even after fabrication. 
The project is divided between computational predictions from density functional theory (DFT) calculations and experimental studies, mainly by scanning probe microscopy. DFT is the ideal theoretical microscope, with higher resolution in energy and space than experiments, while SPM and TEM are the state-of-the-art experimental methods for measuring nanoscale properties. In this interdisciplinary project, the principles of defect chemistry are united with the physics of domain walls to develop circuit elements for neuromorphic computing.",Universiteter,UoH-sektor,12000000,Sverre Magnus Selbach,Institutt for materialteknologi,Trondheim
302624,Deep learning cancer diagnostics from diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging,2020,2023,"The standard approach to investigating cancer using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) involves the injection of a potentially harmful contrast agent. Such contrast is contraindicative for patients who are pregnant, breast-feeding, or have kidney problems, and recent studies have also found evidence of long-term contrast deposition in the brain.

Intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) MRI is the most promising approach to safe, non-contrast perfusion imaging for cancer diagnosis and treatment monitoring. However, IVIM suffers from high sensitivity to measurement noise and imaging artefacts, and has very long acquisition times, such that currently it is not clinically feasible.

We propose a radical new approach to sampling IVIM data that will drastically reduce acquisition time and ameliorate several artefacts. We will use deep learning to enable efficient data acquisition, robust image reconstruction, and accurate IVIM parameter estimation. Deep learning has never before been applied to MRI in this manner, and it is especially well-suited to IVIM imaging. Successful outcomes promise to herald a new age in MRI pulse sequence development, and to transform current clinical strategies in oncology.",Helse Midt RHF,Helseforetak,11992000,Peter While,Klinikk for bildediagnostikk,Trondheim
302635,AFO-JIGG: Service design thinking to improve welfare and product quality in the Norwegian small-scale fishing fleet,2020,2023,"In Norway, the number of fatalities among fishers in the small-scale fleet (SSF) is about five times larger than in the larger coastal vessels and nearly 20 times larger than in the deep sea fishing vessels. The main reason for fatalities involves drowning after vessel disasters, but man-overboard events and drowning in port are also relevant causes.  Although there is a need to re-enforce the “safety culture” in this segment, there is a scope to utilize latest developments in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and service-design thinking with the ambition of creating a safer and healthier environment in the Norwegian jigging fleet, of lowering its ecological footprint, and improving the product quality and economic return to the fishery and coastal society. AFO-JIGG will explore this along two integrated lines of investigation. One line will perform a work (boat and human) and product (fish) flow analysis, to evaluate what operations can be optimized from a human and fish welfare perspective, and what operations can be autonomised or optimized to ensure delivery of a high quality product in a sustainable way. The other line of research will look at the competences of the present work force, skills required in the future and the acceptance by fishers and society at large of the new technology. Automatisation of certain tasks, including navigation and fish handling, may raise legal and ethical issues that must be taken into consideration at early stages of development. AFO-JIGG integrates interdisciplinary insight from environmental, technological, social, and ethical perspectives. The  emphasis on the SSF of northern Norway attempts to mitigate the general lack of R,D&I in this sector and builds on the consensual political support for this fleet. At a time when the maritime industry is facing a technological revolution with the introduction of autonomous vessels and services, there is a window of opportunity to improve and modernize conditions in the jigging fleet.",Universiteter,UoH-sektor,12000000,Melania Borit,"FAKULTET FOR BIOVITENSKAP, FISKERI OG ØKONOMI",Tromsø
302730,Towards the next generation of lubricants by artificial intelligence,2020,2024,"Lubricant formulation and production is a century-old industry in which the development of formulations is still based on existing recipes adding selected additives. The new products need to be tested in a step-wise procedure, starting in lab scale (quick and cheap method), and scaling up until real tests (which are long term, expensive, difficult and complex processes) can be performed. This long, expensive and often frustrating process can be boosted with the help of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Formulating lubricants requires gathering information of available chemicals and substances that have the physical and chemical characteristics required for providing a system with the desired friction and wear. Mining in the available data of chemicals that could potentially become the next generation of lubricants requires new tools, methods,  and new approaches, radically different from  those used until now.
Lubricants are used for achieving the required level of friction and wear rates in moving systems. They can be either liquid, solid or semi-solid (greases). Their formulation is rather simple, i.e. consists of a base fluid in the highest proportion (up to 95%) and an additive package (chemical substances providing functionality and improving its properties). Current state of the art for producing lubricants is based on empirical experience of substances that have been functioning as lubricants for decades. In addition, the additives giving functionality to the lubricant are typically found by trial and error development. An example of this is the additives based on Zn that were originally developed as antioxidants and finally turned out to be the best additives for friction and wear control . However, this approach brings only small incremental improvements in lubricant formulations. Therefore, the development for covering the demands of the new generation of lubricants is happening at lower speed than required for applications and for environmental legislations.",Universiteter,UoH-sektor,10931000,Nuria Espallargas,Institutt for maskinteknikk og produksjon,Trondheim

The project Warring with Machines: Military applications of AI and the relevance of Virtue Ethics constitutes an inquiry into the conditions of human morality in AI-human interaction. It aims to determine how the moral integrity and agency of military personnel may be preserved and enhanced when artificial intelligence is implemented in practices of war. The project will pursue this goal from the perspectives of virtue ethics, philosophy of action and mind, and applied military ethics in close dialogue with institutional stakeholders as well as technologists and representatives from cognitive neuroscience. Its three research questions are as follows: 

(1) How does AI technology change the way we think about the moral character of military personnel? (2) How can we understand the nature of AI technology/tools, and how do these tools change the moral and psychological conditions for virtuous behavior? (3) What does ""virtuous human-AI interaction"" mean in different parts of the military?

303201,New Frontiers of Speech: Linguistic Meaning and Communication in the Information Age,2020,2024,"Rapid advances in information and communication technology (ICT), and in artificial intelligence (AI), and their subsequent rapid uptake by society at large, has significantly changed linguistic communication in a variety of ways. An important and underexplored question is what the impact of all these changes are on the nature of linguistic meaning and communication, and to the fundamental concepts that underpin our accounts of language use. One answer is Revisionism: the view that these developments have substantially changed the nature of linguistic meaning and communication, and that many of our concepts and theories require revision. But which phenomena motivate revisionism and what might these revisions be? The central aim of the project is to develop revisionist models to accommodate changes to the nature of linguistic meaning and communication as a result of the increased prominence of online and digital environments, and artificial language users. More specifically, the project will address the following six research questions: 1. What are the meanings of new referential and anaphoric devices that arise in online/digital communicative environments - like hashtags and hyperlinks? 2. What are the felicity conditions of the new kinds of speech acts that form part of our online/digital communicative environments? 3. How should we account for the content of ""speech"" produced by bots and AIs of various kinds? 4. How has online and digital communication changed the nature or prominence of existing speech acts, like assertion? 5. Are our current notions of ""utterance'"", ""context"", ""discourse"" and ""information structure"" adequate to the task of understanding linguistic meaning and communication in online/digital environments? Do they serve the appropriate meaning-determining role in the semantics of indexicals, and other context- and discourse-sensitive terms? 6. Can bots/AIs lie or mislead?

303258,Securing adaptation of timothy cultivars under climate change and during seed multiplication using genomics and big-data approaches,2020,2023,"Grassland based forage production is the cornerstone of agriculture in Northern Norway. It is important for the economy and it is expected to use local feed resources for the production of milk and meat. Achieving this goal requires higher and more stable yields of high quality forage over years. Timothy is the most important forage species in Norway, especially in the north. The predicted climate change will lead to higher and more variable precipitation patterns. These changes are expected to be more rapid in the north. Development of timothy cultivars that are adapted is crucial for a sustainable forage production in the north. Breeding of new cultivars takes long time with traditional methods – up to 20 years. By using machine-learning methods and genomic selection, it is possible to combine climate and soil data with phenotype and genomic data to predict genomic breeding values. Production of commercial seeds of timothy cultivars bred for Northern Norway is challenging since the production is located in the South Eastern part of Norway. This can lead to risks of genetic shifts in the cultivars and thus change in key traits that are important in the north, e.g. winter survival. Studies of genetic shifts during seed multiplication are limited. In this project, we will study winter survival, estimated as freezing and ice-encasement tolerance in different seed generations of northern timothy cultivars and breeding populations. This information will be combined with molecular marker data for identification of genome regions in timothy associated in genetic regulation of these traits. In addition, we will study potential genetic shifts in seed generations of different age of the northern timothy cultivars ‘Engmo and ‘Noreng’. Historical phenotypic data from multi-location-year yield trials will be combined with climate, soil, and genomic data using advanced machine learning models to develop genomic prediction models for developing of adapted cultivars in the north.",Universiteter,UoH-sektor,8720000,Odd Arne Rognli,NORGES MILJØ- OG BIOVITENSKAPELIGE UNIVERSITET (NMBU),Ås
303331,Optimizing management of musculoskeletal pain disorders in primary care (SUPPORTPRIM),2020,2024,"Musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) is the number one cause of years lived with disability andreduced health worldwide. In Norway, every fourth patient in primary care suffers from MSDs. Treatment effects are however modest and knowledge
of best practice limited. The SUPPORTPRIM project will address these challenges in two main steps:1) To optimize person-centered care, we will employ innovative methods from artificial intelligence in terms of Case-Based Reasoning to build a clinical decision support system (cDSS ) based on patient data already collected in primary care physiotherapy. Case-Based Reasoning aims to solve new problems based on the solutions to similar problems in the past. In other words, previous MSD cases will be used to help similar cases in the future, just as humans learn from their own experience.  We will then assess the efficacy of the cDSS in physiotherapy practice in a randomised controlled trial.2) This effort will be expanded to general practice by implementing The STarT MSK screening Tool as basis for stratified care for MSD patients. The efficacy of the stratified care will be assessed in a randomized controlled trial in general practice. Finally, the cDSS from physiotherapy practice will be extended and adapted to fit general practice. State-of-the-art personalized treatment plans are envisioned to benefit a much larger proportion of MSD patients than a ""one-size-fits-all"" approach. In addition, SupportPRIM facilitates and emphasizes the co-decision process between the patient and physiotherapist. The innovative approach using artificial intelligence to develop personalised decision support systems are far beyond current state of art, is highly relevant for other patient groups in health care, and can be integrated in future medical record systems.",Universiteter,UoH-sektor,11982000,Ottar Vasseljen,Institutt for samfunnsmedisin og sykepleie,Trondheim
303362,Data-driven Algorithms for Physical Simulations,2020,2024,"Modern applications in computational science are governed by multi-scale and partially unknown physically processes that are too complex or poorly understood to be explicitly represented by the governing equations or numerical methods. The plummeting cost of sensors, computational power, and data storage in the last decade offers new opportunities for data-driven modelling of such physical systems. However, while both physical modelling and purely data-driven methods are active independent research areas, little attention has been paid to the intersection of the two. In order to enable a shift  towards simulation models that are either parametrised or controlled by data-driven algorithms, there is a pressing need for new mathematical tools, new numerical abstractions and new algorithms.

The ambition of DataSim is therefore to design efficient algorithms to enable data-driven simulation described by partial differential equations. Specifically, we will propose simulation models that consist of partial differential equations coupled to machine learning models build using artificial neural networks. We will then design new algorithms for model identification, and adaptive control methods for partially unknown and dynamically changing physical systems. Based on these algorithms, we will develop a general software framework for specifying, evaluating and training such models.  The capabilities of our approach will be demonstrated by developing a weather precipitation model from crowd-sourced weather station data.",Øvrige forskningsinstitutter,Instituttsektor,11993000,Simon Funke,SIMULA RESEARCH LABORATORY AS,Bærum
303404,Enabling Graph Neural Networks at Exascale,2020,2023,"Graph neural networks (GNNs), which extend the successful ideas of deep learning to irregularly structured data, are a recent addition to the field of artificial intelligence. While traditional deep learning has focused on regular inputs such as images composed of pixels in two-dimensional space, graph neural networks can analyze and learn from unstructured connections between objects. This gives GNNs the ability to tackle completely new classes of problems, such as analyzing social networks and power grids, or uncovering molecule structures in computational chemistry. Some experts in the field also believe that graph networks, due to their capacity for combinatorial generalization, represent an important next step towards the development of general artificial intelligence. However, such tasks require vast amounts of computation, which can only be provided by parallel processing.

Is well known that parallel computation for irregular problems is much more challenging than for regular ones, and GNNs are no exception. While traditional deep learning has been scaled up to run on entire supercomputers efficiently,     
GNNs currently do not scale to multiple processors. This proposal aims to overcome this limitation by drawing upon decades of experience in scalable graph algorithms and sparse linear algebra, and adapting techniques that are proven to be effective for distributing graph computations over large parallel systems to GNNs.

We aim to create a new computational framework which allows users to specify a GNN while the framework handles the task of distributing graphs over parallel machines, as well as selecting and running the algorithms that are best suited for the computation automatically. Recently, frameworks such as TensorFlow, have made traditional deep neural networks accessible for a large number of users. In the same way, our goal is to create a proof-of-concept framework that will be a crucial factor to the successful GNNs real-world appliance.",Øvrige forskningsinstitutter,Instituttsektor,11820000,Johannes Langguth,SIMULA RESEARCH LABORATORY AS,Bærum
303411,Machine Ocean – Combining Machine Learning and Earth Observations to Improve Simulations of Turbulent Behavior in the Earth System,2020,2024,"The overarching hypothesis for Machine Ocean is that “the present explosion in volume, variety and velocity (VVV) of  Earth Observation acquisition (as spearheaded by the Copernicus, in particular the Sentinel 1 mission) combined with new methods to harvest information from big data will allow us to gain further insights into, and significantly reduce the uncertainty in, parameterization of momentum transfer between atmosphere and ocean.” Vertical momentum transfer is one of the most important process in the Earth System, influencing the transfer of carbon, oxygen, heat, freshwater and other quantities between the different spheres, yet possibly the hardest process to measure. The transfer occurs on small horizontal and temporal scales, so it is almost always necessary to parameterize in numerical simulations. The use of machine learning methods to directly predict turbulent stress in Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations has recently been proposed, and developed for simplified setups, but the field of machine learning applications in fluid dynamics in general and for momentum transfer and larger scale atmosphere models in particular, is in its infancy.",Øvrige forskningsinstitutter,Instituttsektor,11521000,Cecilie Mauritzen,METEOROLOGISK INSTITUTT,Oslo
303514,Interpretable Deep Learning from Electronic Health Records under Learning Constraints,2020,2024,"Patient and population specific data from heterogeneous Electronic Health Records (EHR) are becoming ubiquitous sources for data-driven decision and diagnosis support systems. Deep learning artificial intelligence technologies are emerging as the state-of-the-art for EHR analysis due to their ability to learn complex representations from raw clinical data to obtain strong predictive power combined with an inherent ability to accept multiple data types as input for heterogeneous data fusion. However, key problems and constraints for deep learning systems for health are their lack of interpretability, their inability to exploit vast amounts of unannotated patient data, and their hitherto inability to exploit contextual information to perform well in the low volume data regime, e.g. due to stratification. As a key solution, the DEEPehr project will develop interpretable deep learning predictive systems for a range of EHR input sources, focusing particularly on prediction and prevention of postoperative adverse events. Adverse events, such as infections, are potentially lethal, causing huge suffering for patients and huge costs for healthcare. DEEPehr will develop novel unsupervised and weakly supervised deep learning methodology to exploit the wealth of unannotated patient data for better quality of care, and will leverage the unique hierarchical nature of EHRs for utilizing contextual and prior information to extract new clinical knowledge from low data volumes. Project results and outcomes will impact DEEPehr's clinical stakeholders, and the potential to impact data-driven health and science beyond is great given the generic methodology development core of the project.  DEEPehr is high risk because of the profound challenges and interdisciplinary nature of the endeavor, yet feasible due to the high quality of the team, the extensive mobility, and the top international collaborators, creating the synergy effects needed to reach the ambitious project objectives.",Universiteter,UoH-sektor,12000000,Robert Jenssen,Institutt for fysikk og teknologi,Tromsø
303607,Strawberry Harvester for Polytunnels and Open Fields,2020,2023,"The SHAPE project will develop a fully autonomous harvester for strawberry production in polytunnels and open fields.

Labour shortage is one of the major concerns for strawberry growers around the globe. There is thus a need for new technology to help growers automate this process. The SHAPE project builds on existing developments within the consortium that puts us in a unique position to close the technological gaps needed to make these systems useful for farmers around the world.

The first challenge that needs to be solved is robust and reliable mobility in the field, which is an unstructured environment. The consortium has already developed the Thorvald robot, which is capable of moving autonomously both in polytunnels and in open fields. 

The second large challenge is the identification and picking of the strawberry using a robotic arm. The fruits need to be accurately localized in the field. We find the fruits using a deep neural network and find the location in the three-dimensional space using 3D camera. We will also develop methods for determining the ripeness prior to picking the berry. The consortium has also developed a novel and patent-pending gripper that will be used in the project. The gripper picks the berries by surrounding them entirely before picking. This makes us able to pick berries in the presence of uncertainties and moving berries.

We will also equip this gripper with internal sensors that can estimate the ripeness of the berries and evaluate the quality in a enclosed and controlled environment before harvest. Advanced machine learning will be used to give the robot the ability to reason and make decision in the field, substantially improving the current state-of-the-art by inspecting each and every berry before picking. This will guarantee that diseased berries are not picked and ensure online quality control and grading of the berries.

304229,CONWIND: Research on smart operation control technologies for offshore wind farms,2020,2023,"Offshore wind is still lagging behind onshore wind when it comes to investments, though the potential is huge. In recent years, costs have been driven down, outpacing expectations, due principally to the rapid increase in turbine size. The increased size also leads to increased wakes behind the turbines, which are turbulent wind fields with decreased average wind speed. The wakes are not static, and lead to more fatigue loads on the turbine blades as well as a loss in energy production in the turbines hit by the wakes.

The levelized cost of energy (LCOE), which is the break-even cost to produce energy, can decrease either by diminishing costs or by increasing the energy production. With an intelligent control system it is possible to work on both these options: one may optimize the energy production when the electricity price is high, and one may steer the wakes of the wind turbines in such a way that their impact on the next turbine is less damaging and thus reducing maintenance costs.

The primary objective of the project is therefore to reduce the operating costs and increase the energy production of offshore wind farms through development of advanced control algorithms. Amongst the challenges is to obtain fast and accurate predictions of the wind field in the wind farm, wakes included, to provide the input for the controller. The controller itself must be capable of balancing various demands and take into account the various model uncertainties. To obtain a control system that increases the profitability of offshore wind farms by more than 2% will make a great impact on the profitability of offshore wind farms.",Teknisk-industrielle institutter,Instituttsektor,25000000,Annette Fagerhaug Stephansen,NORCE Teknologi/Energi VESTLAND,Bergen

304612,Predictive maintenance of drilling equipment using deep neural networks,2019,2023,"For any industrial actor that is managing complex equipment and processes on a daily basis, maintenance is crucial for running the operations efficiently and safely. Developing timely and efficient maintenance strategies for systems in operation is currently one of the main industrial challenges. This is of particular importance for complex and critical systems used for drilling operations. 
There are three basic approaches for equipment maintenance: corrective, preventive (planned) and predictive (condition based) maintenance. 
Predictive maintenance is an advancement in the maintenance philosophy. It is far more than just applying condition monitoring technologies. With predictive maintenance repair decisions are based on the condition of the machine rather than on the calendar. Surveys indicate that predictive maintenance leads to significant reduction in maintenance cost, elimination of equipment failure, reduction in rig downtime and increase in production efficiency when compared to other maintenance approaches.
Despite the latest industrial advancements, such as exponential growth of available data combined with technologies like machine learning and artificial intelligence, there remains a low maturity of digitalization across the oil and gas industry. Deep learning emerged lately as a method that can offer promising results for fault diagnosis and prognostics. This is a relatively unexplored area especially when related to oil and gas industry.
This thesis will explore the potential for using deep learning to predict drilling equipment problems and estimate its remaining useful life. Specifically, focus will be to develop and apply deep learning techniques to enable autonomous decision-making for improving service performance through condition-monitoring, predictive maintenance and spares management based on the real-time data available from the drilling rigs in operation.",Næringsliv,Næringsliv,1739000,Pål Skogerbø,MHWIRTH AS,Kristiansand

However, higher levels of autonomy and endurance are needed to fully realize the potential of AIAUVs for providing greener, safer and more cost-efficient operations and obtaining persistent presence in the oceans for ocean exploration and sustainability. AROS will close this knowledge gap. Specifically, we will combine the disciplines of engineering cybernetics, computer science and hydrodynamics, to achieve significant advances in the current state of the art of marine robotics and autonomy, with the goal of realizing true autonomy in underwater sensing, situational awareness, and motion planning, and to achieve unprecedented energy autonomy. The methods for underwater situational awareness will enable the AIAUV to understand, interpret and predict its surroundings. The energy efficient motion planning and the energy harvesting methods will enable extreme endurance and enlarge the areas covered beyond the capabilities of current marine robots.

304843,EXAIGON - EXplainable AI systems for Gradual industry adoptiON,2020,2024,"The recent advances of Artificial Intelligence (AI) hold promise for significant benefits to society in the near future. However, in order to make AI systems deployable in social environments, industry and business-critical applications, several challenges related to their trustworthiness must be addressed first. 

Most of the recent AI breakthroughs can be attributed to the subfield of Deep Learning (DL), but, despite their impressive performance, DL models have drawbacks, with some of the most important being a) lack of transparency and interpretability, b) lack of robustness, and c) inability to generalize to situations beyond their past experiences.

Explainable AI (XAI) aims at remedying these problems by developing methods for understanding how black-box models make their predictions and what are their limitations. The call for such solutions comes from the research community, the industry and high-level policy makers, who are concerned about the potential of deploying AI systems to the real world in terms of efficiency, safety, and respect for human rights.

EXAIGON will advance the state-of-the-art in XAI by conducting research in four areas:
1. Supervised learning models
2. Deep reinforcement learning models
3. Deep Bayesian networks
4. Human-machine co-behaviour.

Areas 1-3 involve design of new algorithms and will interact continuously with Area 4, to ensure the developed methods provide explanations understandable to humans.  The developed methodologies will be evaluated in close collaboration with 7 industry partners, who have provided the consortium with business-critical use cases, including data, models and expert knowledge. 

The consortium includes two international partners from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and University of Melbourne, respectively, who have conducted and published outstanding research in relevant areas over the last few years.",Universiteter,UoH-sektor,15995000,Anastasios Lekkas,Institutt for teknisk kybernetikk,Trondheim
304853,CLoud ARtificial Intelligence For pathologY (CLARIFY),2019,2021,"Pathology has repeatedly been highlighted as being ripe for innovation in terms of workflow efficiency and more accurate diagnostics. In fact, the estimated market growth for digital pathology systems is huge, with the forecast to reach 143 million dollars by 2019 in the EU and 205 million dollars in the USA. Despite this boost in sales, diagnostic pathology in practice today is still a slow and cumbersome process that relies heavily on the subjective interpretation of a microscopic image by a qualified pathologist. This imposes a limitation, even more substantial in small pathology departments where the pathologists might not be specialized in particular areas. 
CLARIFY addresses the challenge to improve pathology departments’ workflow optimising current diagnosis and monitoring processes. With this purpose, CLARIFY’s scientific goal is to develop a robust automated digital diagnostic environment based on cutting-edge technologies (such as digital image processing, artificial intelligence, cloud computing, blockchain, etc.) to enhance knowledge sharing and reach better-informed decisions.
To achieve it, CLARIFY targets to deliver an innovative, multinational, multi-sectorial, and multidisciplinary research and training programme that link two highly differentiated specialities: engineering and medicine, with a focus on digital pathology. CLARIFY’s partnership gathers relevant scientific staff from academia, industry and hospitals, which will be involved in a high-level personalised training programme that will guarantee ESRs and future PhD students outstanding Career Opportunities. CLARIFY will disseminate results to a wide spectrum of stakeholders, create awareness in the general public about digital pathology and encourage careers related to this field among young students.",Ukjent,Annet,60000,Antorweep Chakravorty,Ingen,NA

304912,Novel Intensive-Care-Unit technology for improved survival post- cardiac arrest & resuscitation by closed-loop brain and nerve stimulation,2019,2020,"Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) have become the mainstay technology of resuscitation after cardiac arrest. It is well established that electrical stimulation can re-start the arrested myocardium and therapeutically modulate the heart beat rythm. Yet a similar resuscitation technology to facilitate the recovery of physiologically normal brain activity in the critical hours following cardiac resuscitation does not currently exist.

After a cardiopulmonary arrest and return of spontaneous circulation, 80% of all patients reach the ICU in a comatose state and of these patients, only 20% will survive and regain consciousness. Moreover, as many as 45% of the pediatric patients will die within 1 week after cardiac resuscitation despite having recovered spontaneous circulation, of which 81% are pronounced dead or disconnected from life-support due to neurological damage. A key indicator of such damage is the insufficient recovery of normal EEG activity or the bilateral absence of N20 waves of short-latency somato sensory evoked potentials. While therapeutic hypothermia and fever avoidance provide some neuroprotection, new technologies are clearly needed to support the recovery of normal brain patterns after resuscitation and increase survival.

Recently, one of the partners in the DeepSpark consortium discovered of hypoxia-resilient neurons in the cortex of primates up to 2 hours after total arrest of cardiac activity. We propose that closed-loop selective brain stimulation, time-locked to these neuronal pools, could serve as a trigger of EEG pattern normalization.

Artificial Intelligence deep-learning will be used to set optimal stimulation parameters for vagus nerve and transcranial stimulation as a function of real-time EEG, transcranial infra-read oxygenation and metabolic data, and doppler ultra-sound blood flow information.

The technology developed by the consortium could become a key tool against irreversible decay of brain activity after resuscitation.",Næringsliv,Næringsliv,300000,Enric Claverol,AFFERENT TECHNOLOGIES AS,Oslo

Many antidepressants are available. Yet, finding the right drug for individual patients remains challenging, as 50% of the patients have not found an effective drug treatment after 1 year. Lately, research including MR imaging has shown promising results. We would like to extend this further, using advanced MRI image analysis including deep learning to create a software tool that can be used in assessment of patients with major depression. With our assessment tool, we aim to reduce the time to selection of an antidepressant that the patient responds to by 75%. This will have major health and economic benefits.

experiments in spatio-temporal domains, enabling autonomous platforms to decide on an optimal
strategy of where and when to gather data, in a cost-effective manner. 

Renowned oceanographer Walter Munk called the 20th century, the century
of undersampling, something particularly
relevant in ocean-facing Norway with its complex fjord systems

Once trained, ANNs are computationally very light and potentially adaptable to different datasets. Their use could, therefore, save processing times and, in the long term, impact the whole business sector.

305459,Prediction of postoperative infections,2019,2021,"Infections hit one in four patients, yearly more than 10 million in Europe, after their surgery. On average only after day 5 the the infection is diagnosed with a maximum accuracy of 70% (through biomarkers, vital signs, medication use, past medical history and pre-op risk score) and treatment started. Infections more than double hospital stay and oftentimes necessitate additional invasive treatment, lowering the patient’s quality of life. The cost of treating a post-operative infection is on average €10,000 per patient. Early or even timely recognition of infections fails in the current system. The project team's vision is to disrupt the current post-operative work processes and protocols in hospitals by providing a unique software tool that uses machine learning (ML) algorithms to enable a shift from a diagnostic and responsive system towards a predictive and proactive system. This tool to predict post-surgery infections is based on electronic health records (EHR) data and will be accurate, transportable, robust, scalable, easy-to-use and integratable into existing hospital workflows and IT infrastructures.

305716,Large-scale Deep Learning Algorithms for Video Analysis,2019,2022,"Deep learning is becoming one of the top choices for analyzing medical images. The main attribute of success is the ability of the algorithms to automate the analysis of medical images in a fast and iterable manner. Moreover, such technologies have gained momentum recently due to the development of GPU and the availability of cloud computing resources. Convolutional Neural Networks and Recurrent Neural Networks are popular architectural models in medical image analysis. However, a significant limitation of such technologies is the processing time and unexplainable inaccuracies in real-world datasets. Therefore the most critical R&D challenge is to research and develop an innovative method to analyze ODI's medical video data in a highly accurate, scalable and flexible manner. The medical video data is captured using an innovative medical device, that has reached a prototype stage. The device is a property of ODI Medical AS. The data captured by the ODI device is in the form of sessions. On average, each session contains 6000 frames that need analysis.

- Surveying the state of the art for object detection and classification in deep learning algorithms
- Researching and developing a novel method in object detection and object classification to analyze medical video data using deep learning algorithms
- Surveying the state of the art for large scale deployment of deep learning algorithms

This is motivated by the increasing demand of automation in industry, especially the demand of a safer and more efficient collaboration between multiple cobots and human operators to integrate the best of human abilities (creativity, adaptivity, interaction) and robotic automation (speed, reliability, precision, inexhaustible task execution capability).
Our vision is that the learning of the optimal local control policies can be substantially accelerated by sharing both information about previous experiences and computation across multiple neighbor interconnected cobots, providing solutions that satisfy the necessary real-time constraints in robotic applications, as well as sufficient robustness and interchangeability to the control solutions. 
The main technical novelties are: a) novel local controllers for the collaborative robots based on distributed online deep learning, where each cobot will use a deep reinforcement learning scheme to learn its local policy of shared control, exploiting not only its local experience, but also experience information from other neighbor cobots that will be connected opportunistically through a time-varying inter-cobot wireless network; b) Rich and fluent cobot-human bi-directional interaction and shared control between cobots and human operators, keeping the required safety constraints; c) novel adaptive distributed computation and networking for information aggregation across cobots.

308823,KPN Hole Cleaning Monitoring in drilling with distributed sensors and hybrid methods,2020,2024,"Effective hole cleaning during the drilling process is one of the prerequisites to reducing the incurred economic and environmental cost. Current practice is mostly based on sophisticated physics-based calculations done before the operation starts, in some operations with real-time update during operations, and on human assessment of a limited number of measured parameters like for example trends in hook load when picking up and slacking off the drill string when making connections.

Introduction of high bandwidth data transmission from sensors at many positions along the string, calls for methods that make full use of the increasing number of measured parameters to determine hole cleaning status more accurately and reliably.

Accordingly, this project proposes to develop novel hybrid modelling approaches that will combine the interpretability, robust foundation and understanding of a physics-based modelling approach with the accuracy, efficiency and automatic pattern-identification capabilities of advanced machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms for more accurate and reliable interpretation of downhole and topside drilling data in real time.

308832,PRAI: Predicting Riser-response by Artificial Intelligence,2020,2024,"Deep-water risers are exposed to waves and currents which cause drag forces and accumulation of fatigue damage. While waves play an important role near the surface, deeper down currents and turbulence around the riser dominate the fatigue accumulation by causing Vortex-Induced-Vibrations (VIV). Consequently, VIV represent a safety risk and are a major design consideration adding notable costs during development and operation. 
VIV response prediction tools are traditionally based on semi-empirical methods. Despite huge efforts over the last two decades, the methods still contain significant inherent uncertainties and limitations. As a result, simplifying assumptions are made both during the engineering and operation stages, leading to the application of high safety factors in the VIV response calculation to compensate for the high uncertain in the prediction. This in turn adds costs in terms of VIV suppression devices and/or riser operation constraints. Thus, there is a clear need for developing methods that address the above limitations, providing more accurate response and fatigue predictions, which can be applied in the engineering phase and as a decision support tool for on-board riser management systems.
PRAI will combine a recently developed time domain (TD) prediction model with concepts from machine learning. TD modelling allows for intuitive interpretation of the underlying physical phenomena, while the machine learning infers connections directly from available data. The combination is referred to as 'hybrid analytics', where the existing physics-based response model is improved based on available sensor data, and consequently the final model is alleviated of some of the limitations from the simplifying assumptions. The ambition is to reduce the uncertainties in the riser response predictions and to pave the road for applying the model in an on-board software system with a limited number of sensors.",Teknisk-industrielle institutter,Instituttsektor,10560000,Jie Wu,SINTEF OCEAN AS,Trondheim

The well environment is however harsh and can limit the operative life of conventional electronic down-hole gauges. In recent years fiber optic (FO) based measurement systems have been developed and well deployments have proven this technology to be inherently robust. FO sensing is able to deliver comprehensive well data which is on the verge of making a step change in well and reservoir monitoring capability. A unique ability of FO technology is that a single fibre can capture in real-time temperature variations and the acoustic noise field, from top to bottom of the well. An overall research challenge is to understand the flow generated acoustic events in the wellbore in order to understand the response of the fibre and perform high-fidelity data interpretation of real well FO surveys.

The project's key idea is to combine approaches from natural language processing and data privacy to design a new generation of text anonymisation techniques that simultaneously: 
-Take advantage of state-of-the-art natural language processing techniques (based on deep neural architectures) to derive fine-grained records of the individuals referred to in a given document ;
- Connect these individual records to principled measures of disclosure risk and data utility, with the goal of modifying text documents in a way that prevents the disclosure of personal information while preserving as closely as possible the internal coherence and semantic content of the documents. 

The project will also design dedicated evaluation methods to assess the empirical performance of text anonymisation mechanisms, and examine how these metrics are to be interpreted from a legal perspective, in particular with respect to how privacy risk assessments should be conducted on large amounts of text data. Finally, the project will investigate how these technological solutions can be integrated into organisational processes - in particular how quality control can be performed in direct interaction with text anonymisation tools, and how the level and type of anonymisation can be parametrised to meet the specific needs of the data owner. 

To achieve these objectives, the project brings together a consortium of researchers with expertise in machine learning, natural language processing, computational privacy, statistical modelling, health informatics and IT law.

309082,KnowMe AI - Sensor and machine learning based interpretation of non-verbal communication.,2020,2023,"Peoples who are not able to communicate verbally needs augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) to be understood and to interact with the surroundings.

In order to improve the quality of life of these peoples, and to facilitate the work of guardians and other caregivers, there is a strong need for a solution that can translate non-verbal communication consisting of sound, facial expressions and body gestures, to something understandable.

Today's methodology for translating expressions of persons in need of AAC is based on written notes describing expressions and signs (indexical signs), and the interpretation and response hypothesis. Caregivers often provide assistance to many different people, making it extremely difficult to learn the repertoire of expressions their individual clients have. This results in misinterpretation that leads to frustration, often violent behavior and resignation. To look up written notes take time, and the caregiver’s response time is relevant to how communication is perceived.
 
This innovation aims to develop a system that records sound, facial expressions and body gestures and uses machine learning to interpret the compound expression in real-time. The goal is to facilitate quick and adequate response from the caregiver. The innovation shall be used in everyday situations, both indoors and outdoors. This will ease the everyday life for caregivers, improve quality of life for the person in question and most likely contribute to a positive development of cognitive skills and an extended expression repertoire. The solution will thus support the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.

The innovation is unique to the market and challenges the state of art in image sensor usage and machine learning, and hence is in need of extensive research. The final product will have great impact on the company growth and financial development.

Manually finding solutions to the scheduling problem is not only time-consuming but highly inefficient both for the maintenance companies and their customers, and inefficient solutions are costly because they lead to increase downtime as well as poor utilisation of personell and other costly resources. Still, scheduling is today largely a manual processes because existing tools in this area suffer from some major shortcomings: They are complex specialist tools, yet no single tool takes into account the full range of dimensions in the complex ""puzzle"" to be solved, and they are not well suited to handle the highly dynamic nature of the problem. Rapid changes in weather conditions, delays and missing personell or part arrivals call for plans to adapt rapidly, but current tools and manual practices are nowhere near being able to completely and rapidly reassess the totality of the schedule. 
The project described here will make this possible by adding powerful new capabilties to VISAVI LivePlan - a digital coordination arena that contains all the data required for optimal scheduling. The new solution will employ multivariable optimization to automate scheduling and also use machine learning to add further automation and robustness. The project will also be highly mindful of the human and organizational factors and challenges of attempting such a radical transformation of well-established, critical work processes. An interdisciplinary approach will be adopted to ensure a holistic solution with proven customer value.",Næringsliv,Næringsliv,16000000,Øystein Veland,VISAVI TECHNOLOGY AS,Oslo

309230,SFI AutoShip: Autonomous Ships for Safe and Sustainable Operations,2020,2028,"Autonomous ships have recently received significant attention in the maritime industry on a global level. The market is projected to reach USD 13.8 billion by 2030, driven by expected cost reductions in maritime and offshore operations, and improved safety of transportation. Societal safety will also be increased with transportation moved from roads to sea. The Norwegian maritime industry, with projects like Yara Birkeland, is currently one of the market leaders, but countries such as China, Japan, South Korea and Finland pose strong competition. Therefore, for Norway to stay ahead, it is imperative to take the lead in strategic areas of autonomous shipping.
The Centre partners have identified the trade-off between safety and cost of operations as critical for the future of autonomous shipping. The following areas are identified as key enablers for balancing the trade-off, and thus the focus areas of the Centre:
1) Disruptive technological innovations, in areas such as sensor fusion and situational awareness, AI, autonomy and automation, digital infrastructure, human factors and remote-control centres, simulation and testing technology.
2) New business models that look at the larger transport system and result in design of sustainable operations.
3) Addressing the overarching challenge of safety and assurance, to guarantee that integration of all technology components will satisfy predefined operational performance and safety requirements in a holistic manner
The aforementioned challenges cannot be solved in isolation. The added value of SFI AutoShip is to gather key actors from the Norwegian maritime cluster, representing the whole spectrum of end users, product and service providers, research institutes, universities and authorities to address these challenges. Through long-term research activities based on applied use cases, the Centre will educate highly qualified graduates will staff the Norwegian industry and help it stay ahead of the competition.",Universiteter,UoH-sektor,95999000,Mary Ann Lundteigen,NORGES TEKNISK-NATURVITENSKAPELIGE UNIVERSITET NTNU,Trondheim

Incidents that lead to patient harm, and in worst cases to loss of lives, bring huge losses and long-lasting consequences for patients, family members, involved hospital personnel, as well as society.  

To address such a challenge and detect potential risks at an early phase, it is imperative to develop a means or system that is capable of improving inpatient safety, by monitoring and analyzing agitated and unusual behaviors as well as generating alerts to responsible personnel on an automatic, continuous, and 24/7 basis. 

Motivated by the recent advancement in IoT and ML technologies, the StaySafe project makes a joint effort to develop a viable solution for behavior surveillance and analysis of inpatients in mental and somatic healthcare, by integrating data collection based on non-intrusive IoT devices and detection of unusual behavioral patterns based on ML algorithms for the purpose of behavior analysis and risk prevention. We believe that such a solution will be able to provide high-level decision support based on real-time data collection and analysis, thus helping prevent agitated patient behavior through early stage warning to on-duty personnel as well as involved inpatients

Food processes are extremely complex and challenging to measure due to the inherent high level of biological variation in raw materials. The development of advanced solutions that are built on a fundamental understanding of food science, will allow the food industry to effectively measure and handle these variations, enabling a ground-breaking digital transformation of the industry. Effective strategies for real-time analysis and utilization of industrial data at a large scale will optimise processes and reduce waste throughout the value chain. New levels of information flow will also significantly increase productivity. 
DigiFoods will innovatively combine applied and basic research to generate new basic knowledge, evaluate prototype solutions, and create results for innovation in the following core areas 1) novel sensor systems and food application development, 2) robot and sensor integration, 3) integrated inline sensor solutions, and 4) analysis and utilisation of large-scale process and value chain data. A multi-disciplinary team comprising food companies, technology providers and research institutions is highly motivated to collaborate towards this common goal. The industrial partners will participate in all research tasks, committing essential in-kind contributions to the project. A critical element of this centre is that much of the experimental work will be done in the industrial process lines, which the end-users will make available for research.

309307,AI-basert risikomodell for vegetasjon langs kraftlinjer,2020,2022,"Avbrudd i strømforsyningen har store samfunnsmessige konsekvenser og kostnader, og vegetasjon er den største enkeltårsaken til strømbrudd. Med klimaendringer forventes forekomsten av strømbrudd grunnet vegetasjon å øke.

Hovedmålet med prosjektet er derfor å utvikle en operasjonell løsning for lokal risikovurdering av tresikkerhet som nettselskaper kan bruke til prioritering og effektivisering av skogrydding langs kraftlinjer og planlegging av beredskap.

Ved å hensynta egenskaper ved enkelttrær og voksestedets egenskaper, kan risikotrær identifiseres, fremfor å gjennomføre tradisjonell og ressurskrevende breddehogst. Kombineres dette med avstand til kraftlinjene, nettspesifikk informasjon og ulike værscenarioer, vil nettselskapene få et bedre beslutningsgrunnlag for å planlegge vedlikehold av kraftlinjegatene. Løsningen vil bidra til effektivisering av nettdrift og sikrere strømleveranser. 

Prosjektet bidrar dermed til FNs bærekraftsmål nummer ni – å bygge robust infrastruktur.

FoU utfordringene i prosjektet er tredelt: 
1. Å utvikle metoder for å bestemme viktige egenskaper ved trær (tretype, høyde, diameter mm) langs kraftlinjer, basert på data innsamlet med droner og kunstig intelligens. Dette innebærer å utvikle nye metoder for å bestemme stabilitets-egenskaper i stående trær, egenskaper som i liten grad har vært i fokus i tidligere modeller. Prosjektet vil utforske bruk av dyp læring for å bestemme trevariabler.
2.

The project will enable a base of sensors and processing systems that will allow unmanned systems to be operated partially disconnected from direct human influence or to handle exceptions and failures without involving human interaction. A part of the project is also to build sensors and systems to allow processing of data in a efficient manner to reduce the requirement for human processing of data as the number of unmanned units will operate in a dense area in coastal areas. The most important task in order to increase safety is to conduct research on sensors for more precise inertial navigation, sensors for visual information processing, and systems for redundant high precision positioning based on wireless microwave technology. The combination of such systems and reliable systems for assessment of actions in case of diverging sensor information is crucial for safe operations of unmanned vehicles.

Examples of state-of-the-art missing links:
* A vessel equipped with a simple wireless jammer is currently able to stop inspection by unmanned vehicles or cause dangerous situations with unmanned vehicles operating blind
* An operation of more than 2-3 vehicles is for practical and safety reasons not possible to operate in a dense area because coordination operators in the same area would require special training and would increase risk of misunderstandings and incidents.
* An unmanned operation needs careful planning and does not include sudden operative changes. In case of sudden operative changes, the mission will have to be aborted and re-planned.
* Observations are not automated. A single operator required for each video sensor in operation in an area.
* Emergency procedures are not automated",Næringsliv,Næringsliv,10249000,Øystein Pedersen,RADIONOR COMMUNICATIONS AS,Trondheim
309334,Extending the impact of STOP-IT in Norway (STOP-IT_N),2020,2021,"The convergence of sensors, processors, and actuators has transformed purely physical water systems into cyber-physical. Advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence are making cyber-physical systems unique in performance and efficiency. The emergence of cyber-physical systems holds great promise, but it also increases the exposure to cyber threats. The relevance for implementing digital technologies in the water domain has to rely on the identification of its benefit versus the potential increased vulnerability. To this end, STOP-IT has developed solutions and best practice to protect water critical infrastructure against physical and cyber threats. STOP-IT has been running for two years now and most of the solutions are ready for demonstration. While Norwegian water utilities are quite mature in protecting the water assets from physical threats, there is a need to provide solutions to detect, prevent and react to cyber threats and to help developing risk management plans for the integrated cyber-physical layers. 
STOP-IT_N aims at supporting the Norwegian water sector digital transformation, by using the requested funding to increase the STOP-IT impact in Norway. The activities planned are: 1 workshop with expert communities to share knowledge and identify cybersecurity gaps in practice and in research and the outcomes of the workshop will be published in a technical magazine (VANN); training activities for students and water utilities operators; participation to the leading international water conference (IWA 2020) to showcase the results of STOP-IT; the production of a practical guide, tailored to the Norwegian priorities, to introduce cyber security by design in treatment plants and to be made freely available; 1 final conference to present the guide, receive feedback for its finalization and to let directly Oslo VAV and Bergen Kommune share with other water utilities the knowledge and know-how from STOP-IT.",Teknisk-industrielle institutter,Instituttsektor,1000000,Rita Ugarelli,SINTEF AS,Trondheim
309359,SAKULATOR - Innovasjonsprosjekt om utviklingen av kalkulator for estimering av saksbehandlingstider i Norges domstoler,2020,2022,"En økende mengde komplekse saker har økt saksbehandlingstiden i flere av Norges domstoler. For å imøtekomme krav om økt effektivitet går domstolene idag gjennom en omfattende digitaliseringsprosess. Som et ledd i digitaliseringen tar SAKULATOR sikte på å utvikle en datadrevet prediksjonsmodell (Sakulator) for estimering av saksbehandlingstider i domstolene. Sakulator vil (1) bistå dommere i den krevende oppgaven det er å anslå saksbehandlingstider i komplekse saker, og (2) synliggjøre hvilke faktorer som driver saksbehandlingstider opp, og på den måten være et viktig styringsverktøy for dommere i deres arbeid med å planlegge og beramme saker.  

Sentrale FoU-utfordringer:
1. Generere datasett: Domstolene bruker idag saksbehandlingsverktøyet Lovisa for å registrere informasjon om sakene til behandling. En sentral utfordring er å bearbeide og organisere informasjonen fra Lovisa slik at det kan brukes i Sakulator.
2. Modellutvikling: Målet med Sakulator er å predikere det ukjente (saksbehandlingstid) fra det kjente (saksegenskaper og saksbehandlingsprosesser). En sentral utfordring i prosjektet er å utvikle en modell som fanger opp kompleksiteten i sakene og gir realistiske estimater på saksbehandlingstider.
3. Realisering: En sentral FoU-utfordring å overføre modellen som ligger til grunn for Sakulator til en brukervennlig web-applikasjon som forenkler og effektiviserer hverdagen til brukerne.

For domstolene vil det å anvende en kunnskapsbasert prediksjonsmodell synliggjøre hvilke faktorer som påvirker  saksbehandlingstider. For dommerne vil det være enklere å ha en effektiv saksstyring dersom de får et tydeligere bilde på hvilke og hvordan disse faktorene driver saksbehandlingstiden opp. Sakulator vil også være et nyttig verktøy i berammingen av saker og i diskusjonen om ressursfordeling mellom domstoler. På sikt vil kalkulatoren kunne skape forutsigbarhet for eksterne aktører, samt innsikt i hvordan de kan bidra til å overholde mål for saksbehandlingstider.",Øvrige offentlige,Øvrige,3734000,Bjørn-Are Lyngstad,DOMSTOLENE I NORGE,Trondheim
309371,INHUD: Intelligent Handheld Ultrasound Device,2020,2024,"Creating images of the interior of the human body is a crucial ingredient to modern medical diagnostics. Unfortunately, equipment for such medical imaging is typically bulky and expensive to buy, operate, and maintain. At points where care is given most frequently, such as at the general practitioner’s office, in an ambulance, emergency room, or a nursing home, medical imaging is therefore largely absent today. While small, portable ultrasound scanners could revolutionize this situation and bring affordable and side-effect-free ultrasound to the point of care, widespread adoption of such devices has not happened yet. This is mostly due to the large amount of training required to confidently operate ultrasound scanners, which poses an unreasonable investment for less experienced, occasional users.

The vision of this project is to create an Intelligent Hand-held Ultrasound Device – INHUD – that visually assists healthcare professionals with little or no ultrasound experience in the device’s operation and in their clinical decision making. Our ambition is to offer a new hand-held imaging solution which opens the door to ultrasound for occasional users and provides significantly increased productivity and diagnostic confidence also for more experienced ones.

The most important R&D challenges we together with our partner SINTEF expect to address in this project are
- to gain a spatial understanding of the scanned area,
- to perform intelligent full-body anatomy labelling in scanned ultrasound images,
- to intelligently visualize regions of medical interest,
- to provide visual aid for probe handling to the user,

The biggest challenge in the safety industry today is to catch up with technology in a secure and safe manner. Technology developed “yesterday” will not meet the requirements for “tomorrow”, and in the global market there is a constant drive for new features, industry demands and cyber security threats.  The future fire alarm system cannot be affected by rapid change in technology or critical components being discontinued. 

With this project, Autronica Fire and Security is addressing the need to retain and improve adherence to the rigid safety standards of fire detection and the ever more important needs for security. Autronica Fire and Security will be in the forefront of applied research in the safety-critical fire detection domain by investigating the use of new technologies adapted to safety applications. 
 
Globally, customers tend to demand low investment costs but may afford a slightly higher operation cost.

309471,"Automatisert kamerabasert inspeksjon av jernbaneinfrastruktur - 
Image Analysis Railway Infrastructure",2020,2023,"En velfungerende og sikker jernbane er helt nødvendig i et moderne samfunn. For at jernbaneinfrastrukturen skal imøtekomme kravene til togtrafikk, samtidig som at sikkerheten opprettholdes, må både skinnegang, sporveksler, strømtilførsel og signalanlegg ha god kvalitet og være godt vedlikeholdt. Prosjekteier Bane NOR bruker i dag i hovedsak manuell arbeidskraft til inspeksjon av jernbaneinfrastruktur, ofte med personell i skinnegangen. Dette krever stans av all togtrafikk for å ivareta sikkerheten til ansatte og passasjerer. Det er spesielt tre tog-faglige inspeksjonsområder hvor behovet er stort for å redusere bruk av personell i skinnegangen (i) inspeksjon av skinnegang, (ii) inspeksjon av sporveksler, og (iii) inspeksjon av kontaktledningssystemet.

Visjonen for dette innovasjonsprosjektet er derfor å utvikle en løsning for inspeksjon ved hjelp av kamerabasert datafangst og automatisk bildeanalyse som betydelig effektiviserer inspeksjonen av jernbaneinfrastruktur i form av redusert behov for personell i skinnegang, reduserte personellkostnader og rask og objektiv analyse.

Sentrale utfordringer i IARI blir å lage algoritmer som er robuste og som har tilstrekkelig høy ytelse (deteksjons og klassifikasjonsnøyaktig). Vi vil basere metodikken på dyp læring, som har revolusjonert bildeanalyse for flere bruksområder. Forskningsinnsatsen vil være fokusert mot å tilpasse eksisterende generell dyp-lærings-baserte algoritmer til jernbanefaglige formål og å trene disse algoritmene til å gjenkjenne relevante feil, avvik og mangler i henhold til prosjektets mål.

Ved et vellykket innovasjonsprosjekt vil Bane NOR implementere automatisk inspeksjon og dataanalyse som en del av den operasjonelle inspeksjonsaktiviteten som allerede foregår, men også investere i innkjøp og innleie av kameraer, droner, datainfrastruktur og datalagring.",Øvrige offentlige,Øvrige,4000000,Arnt-Børre Salberg,BANE NOR SF,Hamar
309512,CRIMAC - Centre for research-based innovation in marine acoustic abundance estimation and backscatter classification,2020,2028,"Fisheries acoustics is used to monitor the largest fish and krill stocks in the world’s oceans and to study marine ecosystems. A modern fishery without acoustic tools for detection, inspection and monitoring of seabed, schools, and the catching process is unthinkable. New wideband echo sounders offer a new opportunity in this arena for Norwegian science and industry. Science and fishing vessels can not only observe the echo amplitude and density of fish under the vessel, but also utilize the backscattered echo spectrum from the organisms. For simplicity, we prefer to define this as the echo dialect of the objects, as for example, an echo from an individual herring is affected by body shape, swim bladder, body constituent and behavior, and is different from the mackerel “echo dialect"". We propose that systematic experimental and in situ research can be used to understand and interpret the different echo dialects from fish and marine organisms. We will further expand on existing multifrequency methods for classification and target sizing by utilizing modern machine learning techniques. This will improve the accuracy of existing monitoring methods and help the fishing skipper to make good catch decisions. Further, direct optical observations from the trawl and use of active selection devises will reduce bycatch. For accurate verification of acoustic recordings, we need continuous optical information from the trawl cod end. This will be achieved with the Scantrol DeepVision system, here tested with active selection devices, and open/closing nets. Discrete samples may then be taken sequentially in deep water, such as in mesopelagic communities. Wideband technology has been miniaturized and can be installed in probes, bottom landers, and surface and underwater unmanned vehicles (drones).

This technology will improve management practices for sea-based fish farms, which today entail manual and often challenging inspections and monitoring of equipment, structures and biomass, resulting in sub-optimal and costly operations, insufficient maintenance, lack of control in daily routines and increased risks for personnel and fish welfare. The Digital Twin Framework will integrate real time data from sensors and numerical models, estimators, statistical models and machine learning techniques with the operational and maintenance history of a fish farm. This will provide a holistic digital representation (""twin"") of the farm and farm operations that can serve farmers' needs to enhance available single measurements and other datapoints for providing insight into parameters related to the structure (e.g. loads, deformations), biomass (e.g. growth, feed consumption, swimming fatigue and stress level) and environmental conditions.

The project will focus on R&D challenges associated with sensor technologies for monitoring fish performance and structural conditions, real-time simulation models for both fish and structures, data-analysis and estimation techniques, and integration methods for hardware and software - all of which are needed to realize the Digital Twin Framework. The realization of the outlined innovation comprises a very high potential for value creation for the involved partners, allowing them to offer a new pioneering and revolutionary technology for the aquaculture industry.",Ukjent,Annet,219365,Eleni Kelasidi,Ingen,NA

This will allow testing performance and comparability and generate novel predictions to drive developments in AI and bring deep insight to brain function. This may change how neuroscience research is conducted and solve current limitations within AI. With the Center for Integrative Neuroplasticity (CINPLA, UiO), we have developed an internationally leading interdisciplinary research activity. We build on established expertise in neuroscience and physics-based computational modeling to solve long standing questions in neuroscience. We are also in lead integrating computational skills into science education. However, to reach our ambition, become an international powerhouse and realize the potential in the coupling between neuroscience and AI research, we need to combine our competence with complementary, world-leading competence currently lacking in Norway. This is provided by carefully selected partners who bring access to: unique hardware and neural recordings, expertise in human cognitive tasks, large-scale network simulations and expertise in statistical tools to compare brain and ANNs. Success requires long-term interdisciplinary investments, a common, ambitious research strategy, and a collective push to educate the workforce of  tomorrow in these fields, which can only be achieved through a long-term joint commitment. We must therefore go beyond individual international collaborations and develop long-term strategic partnerships on both research and education to: (i) train students with the combined competences of the partners needed for breakthroughs in AI-neuroscience interactions, and (ii) strengthen our position as an internationally leading research center.",Universiteter,UoH-sektor,4499000,Marianne Fyhn,UNIVERSITETET I OSLO,Oslo

En av utfordringene i dag er å inspisere knutepunkter på bærestrukturen under vann, og spesielt rett under overflaten i skvalpesonen. Prosjektet skal derfor utvikle en inspeksjonsrobot for kontroll av sveisefuger i knutepunkter. Inspeksjonsdataene som innhentes er basis for integritetsanalyser, som er nødvendig for beregning av gjenværende levetid for plattformene. 

For å kunne gjennomføre en effektiv inspeksjon skal inspeksjonsroboten kunne plasseres ut ved inspeksjonsområdet hvor den holder seg fast, og skal deretter detektere, posisjonere, inspisere og loggføre inspeksjonsdata. 

Prosjektet skal samarbeide med SINTEF, som vil være ansvarlig for forskningen. De ligger langt fremme i forskningen innen inspeksjonsmetoden Eddy Current som benyttes for sprekkinspeksjon. Innsamling av data med inspeksjonsroboten krever en ny og pålitelig posisjoneringsteknologi. En kontinuerlig og presis måling av posisjonen er nødvendig for å kunne optimalisere inspeksjonen og for å dokumentere måleresultater presist og digitalt. I dag benyttes tradisjonelle kamera til dette. Ny kunnskap er nødvendig for å utvikle et 3D kamera som kan møte måleutfordringene i skvalpesonen på en god måte. SINTEF vil også være sentral innen dette området.

Med moderne og forbedrede målemetoder vil eierne av plattformene få bedre data for å vurdere levetidsforlengelser på aktuelle plattformer.

309554,Enhancing quality and efficiency in the RFP to Production Lifecycle.,2020,2023,"Today millions of hours, human resources, and euro, are used to manually produce documents of different forms. The process lifecycle demands collaborative efforts in deciding to answer an RFP, writing the Proposal, writing the Contract and executing the Contract. Sales organizations spend considerable human resources and expend many man hours in analyzing and answering RFPs, and writing the Contract if it is accepted. The delivery organization subsequently exhausts further significant amounts of time understanding the written Contract and following up what should be delivered.

Xait aims to dramatically reduce both the calendar time, and resource time and manpower, consumed by this process lifecycle to efficiently analyze, write, understand and follow up the documents. Xait will utilize AI, Machine Learning (ML), Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Natural Language Understanding (NLU) techniques to analyze, categorize, trace appropriate content between requirements and delivery obligations, and suggest additional or replacement content for the identified necessary human participants. In addition, these techniques will be employed to improve the quality and completeness of documents to assist the decision making of human actors for ultimately better Proposals and Contracts.

However, neither Xait, nor any of its competitors, have yet developed AI-based NLP/NLU solutions within document processing software for professional users. Existing solutions on the market help partially automate the process and take the contributors through a set of stages, but these software do not yet realize the value of intelligent automation by either leveraging the users' own text at a granular level, or taking the contributor's competency and role into account, for analyzing or classifying the incoming RFP or consequently producing suggestions for the outgoing Proposal.",Næringsliv,Næringsliv,10800000,John Ingve Eielsen,XAIT AS,Stavanger

The changing nature of weather and climate poses a severe threat to the prosperity and well-being of our economy and society as a whole, but climate risk is inadequately managed due to knowledge gaps and deficiencies in the decision-making processes of businesses and public authorities.

We will address this critical challenge by working with a large group of partners to co-develop better methods and practices for climate risk management. The breadth and commitment of our consortium testify to an indisputable need for a large and cross-sectoral centre for addressing climate risks. It unites world-leading weather and climate scientists, economists and statisticians with industrial sectors – food production, energy, shipping, insurance, management consulting and risk management – and public authorities, including all the county governors in Norway. Together, we will expand established collaborations and ongoing initiatives to create an active industry-oriented research cluster. 

The work in Climate Futures will be organized in user-driven projects, ranging from short pilots lasting a few weeks or months to long-term strategic programmes over several years. Such a project-based structure was chosen to ensure that each partner takes an active role in the implementation and performance of the centre’s activities, and to ensure cooperation between the partner organizations across sectors and disciplines. The partners in Climate Futures will benefit from extended networks, enhanced knowledge, and new opportunities for innovation, all strengthening their positions in a globalized economy that increasingly requires sophisticated climate risk management.",Miljøinstitutter,Instituttsektor,95999191,Erik Wilhelm Kolstad,NORCE Klima,Bergen

To our knowledge, dedicated study programs in systems medicine do net yet exist in Norway. This project will bring together a team of leading experts from five renowned academic institutions [in Norway (2), the United States (1) and Russia (2)]. They will develop a unique portfolio of systems medicine training – from molecular mechanisms to disease treatment. The courses will include experimental and computational analyses of metabolic pathways and signaling networks, chemical biology of cancer, advanced analytical techniques, mathematical modelling and machine learning as well as principles of drug development. Based on well-established scientific collaborations with all partners, UiB will coordinate the project. Practical courses will be conducted in the relevant partner institutions. The EU consortium on systems medicine of breast cancer (MESI-STRAT) and the NeuroSysMed center (FKB, Bergen) will support this initiative with their competences.
This INTPART project will also significantly contribute to the scientific excellence of existing joint research projects among all parners. A major focus will be on the biology and medical significance of coenzymes derived from vitamin B precursors, a hot area of current biomedical research both in metabolomics, signaling and for the development of nutritional therapeutic concepts. 
Collectively, the project will enable tight collaborations with outstanding academic environments in systems medicine, beyond existing EU initiatives, to develop world-class training in systems medicine. Moreover, it will provide the opportunity for outstanding research that no partner institution on its own would be able to conduct.

309576,Clamp-on Mud Flow Rate and Quality Measurement,2020,2022,"Missing real-time information on drilling mud behavior accounts for a significant part of 30% loss of offshore drilling production time resulting from poor drilling reliability.  Drilling efficiency and safety is a priority area in the OG21 strategy for NCS and high North drilling activities.
Equinor approached Xsens AS 2018 for testing of clamp-on ultrasonic flow meters installed directly on the mud pipe and test results (SPE-195624-MS) confirms the potential to cover required mud qualities and fluid complexity.  The planned innovation project target in- and return-flow of both water- and oil-based mud flow rate measurement. Information on mud density and viscosity will also be addressed, as well as partly filled pipe flow measurement.  The project R&D team covers acoustics, mud rheology, machine learning and industry expertise.  
Research is required to obtain a model for the velocity profile calculation of non-Newtonian drilling fluids, valid for fluid information obtained by multi-path acoustic guided wave sensors, forming chordal paths within the pipe cross-section, at a known distance between pipe center and pipe wall. The model must account for variation in mud rheology of different mud qualities including presence of cuttings and gas. In addition to flow measurement correction, the model will be used for calculation and correction of mud density and viscosity measurement.  
The most critical research challenge is to obtain the accuracy required for the complex fluid behavior and variation in fluid qualities of mud, hence multi-path and multi-mode measurement enhanced by machine learning will be implemented for continuous measurement improvement.   The project includes prototype testing at North Sea offshore drilling facilities towards end of the project. For Xsens the planned clamp-on mud flow meter represents an attractive business case at high ROI for oil companies and drilling operators, for commercialization immediately after project  completion.",Næringsliv,Næringsliv,3248000,Kjell-Rune Toftevåg,XSENS AS,Bergen

309592,Reversing antimicrobial resistance (AMR),2020,2023,"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is emerging as a major global threat to health care. The AMR challenge has escalated further  the last 3 years. We propose a unified INTPART approach for research-based education in innovative preventive and therapeutic measures along with development of novel diagnostics to combat AMR. The AMR-PART partnership is formed by strong research groups in Norway with complementary and multidisciplinary expertise teamed up with outstanding international BRIC collaborators in South Africa, India, China and the US.
The AMR-PART project addresses the nature and role of chromosomally mediated antibiotic resistance with Mtb and Ng as model organisms. Tuberculosis affects 1/3 of the world's population. The incidence of AMR is still emerging as a public health problem worldwide. The AMR-PART project builds on the hypothesis that the current epidemics are fuelled by the selection of adapted and resistant microbial variants, due to antibiotic treatment. As antibiotics apply selective pressure, we postulate that hypermutating strains are likely to emerge, perpetuating the selection of multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant strains. Consequently, components induced under antibiotics-stress will be investigated as potential drug targets. Mutant libraries will be constructed and component collections will be screened in combination with rational drug design to discover novel inhibitors. Hits identified will be characterized for their mechanism of action. Advanced courses, workshops and training will be established for each step of the experimental plan required to reach these goals. The expected outcome will be a pipeline of educational tools facilitating knowledge on AMR, in line with  UN sustainable development goals # 3, 4, 8, 9 and 17. The research-based education will facilitate novel diagnostics, drug targets and drug leads over-riding AMR, as well as capacity building and frontline research-based education in sustainable settings.",Universiteter,UoH-sektor,3500000,Tone Tønjum,UNIVERSITETET I OSLO,Oslo
309594,Iris.ai - the AI Chemist,2020,2022,"Iris.ai is building a set of innovative artificial intelligence-tools for chemical research. Using the latest breakthroughs in text understanding these tools will allow researchers to automatically do what today not only needs to be done manually, but often is so tedious and time consuming it can not be done. These tasks include identifying novel application areas for existing compounds from scanning millions of research papers and patents, both finding applications that are described directly and finding applications that can be inferred from several sources. 

The key R&D challenge to achieve this is to develop an artificial intelligence algorithmic core engine within natural language understanding, mainly concerning understanding similarity, compositionality, causality and ranking metrics. More specifically, the research challenges for this project is to research and develop domain-specific knowledge discovery with context aware word-embeddings as well as domain specific entity embeddings. The engine should be able to build unique representation of the provided chemical element, link it to existing written knowledge available (patents, science articles, etc.) about the element or  similar such elements and finally organize that knowledge into application areas and presented it to the user. Additionally we will extend the functionality of that engine to be able to infer application areas that are not explicitly derived from the literature, but are linked based on linkages in between connected elements in the body of knowledge.

We will verify those objectives in close collaboration with clients from the Chemical Industry, which will provide us with an Ontology of interest, and examples from their day-to-day work.

309598,Sensegrid - a technology platform for monitoring and analysing real-time grid data.,2020,2023,"The electrical power grid is critical infrastructure in any modern society, and the utilities which own and operate this infrastructure are currently facing unprecedented change. Decentralized energy production, intermittent renewable energy production and a general electrification represent a paradigm-shift for how electric utilities operate and plan their grids. Today, most power grids are operated based on static safety limits and experience-based models and forecasts, with relatively few sources of real-time data. Sensegrid is a project whose goal is to research and develop a technology platform for sensing, monitoring and analyzing real-time grid data, providing insight and decision support for transmission and distribution system operators. The project is centered around the development of an overhead line sensor which can be installed on power lines, measuring its condition. 

The data produced by these sensors provide a unique opportunity to develop new tools which have previously not been possible to realize. One of these is Dynamic Line Rating (DLR) of lines, which allows the system operator to maximize the capacity of their grid, without compromising safety, when environmental conditions allow it. The project will also examine new solutions for fault detection, ice monitoring and prediction and grid planning. By researching and developing these solutions, existing infrastructure be utilized more efficiently, failures can be avoided and detected immediately and localized with higher accuracy, maintenance can be planned better, and grid investments can be postponed or avoided. The main research challenge is related to building accurate and reliable data models which can be used in grid operation based on real-time data. Given the importance of the grid as critical infrastructure, the tools and models developed need to have tight statistical tolerance limits, with a high level of confidence, if they are to be used for dynamic grid operations.",Næringsliv,Næringsliv,10750000,Knut Sandven,HEIMDALL POWER AS,Sandnes
309599,Triple Partnership for Socially Responsible AI,2020,2023,"The development and implementation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) within all domains of business, society, and governance has accelerated in recent years. Although current debate chiefly focuses on the economic consequences of AI, there is a growing awareness of the broader societal impacts of AI, especially of the actual and potential impact which AI has on underrepresented and marginalized communities. AI technologies are currently being developed, deployed, and adopted without sufficient consideration of the unequal ways in which their benefits and harms may be distributed across populations, geographies, and contexts. 

The proposed Triple Partnership for Socially Responsible AI (3AI) will engage three academic institutions and their wider research networks to address this pressing issue: The Nordic Centre for Internet and Society at BI Norwegian Business School BI (NCIS), The Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society at Harvard University (BKC), and The Institute for Technology & Society in Rio de Janeiro (ITS). As a joint effort able to leverage globally diverse viewpoints, topical knowledge, and practical experience, this Triple Partnership will strengthen pre-existent project-based collaboration and enable the mutual exchange of students, young researchers, and practitioners across all three institutions. 

Through facilitating international student exchanges, specialist academic courses, policy workshops, and multi-stakeholder conferences, the 3AI project will result in (a) the development of a shared understanding and more harmonized series of research efforts that rigorously assess the different impacts that AI technologies have across different populations, geographies, and contexts; and (b) the transfer of applied insights across academia, change agents from the public and private sectors, as well as the next generation of leaders to ensure that AI technologies advance the social good rather than perpetuate or exacerbate social inequalities.",Vitenskapelige høyskoler,UoH-sektor,4500000,Samson Yoseph Esayas,STIFTELSEN HANDELSHØYSKOLEN BI,Oslo
309603,Machine Learning for Transparent and Sustainable Investing,2020,2024,"The underlying idea of ML for ESG-investing is to include environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors, enable full transparency, and lower the cost and friction to more sustainable investing. This will be achieved by integrating these trends into a portfolio construction tool designed around interpretable machine learning and inclusion of ESG factors.

To go beyond the (publicly acknowledged) commercial state of the art will require the R&D activities to address the following core issues.
1. Exploitation of advances in applying machine learning to factor investing suggests significant improvements in estimating the expected return of assets.
2. Most published papers that employ machine learning tend to omit a sensitivity analysis of the models with respect to factors. To meet our ambitions of transparency, we must extend previous work accordingly.
3. Commercially available ESG factors are not transparent about their construction and are aggregated at levels too high to use in factor investing. Construction of climate risk factors from scratch allows for more transparency and our own choice of aggregation level.

We will adopt an iterative approach towards the research and implementation work. We will work towards successively more complex models and successively integrate more data only when the previous steps have been passed and verified.

The anticipated R&D results of the project that will support the development of the portfolio construction tool are:
1. Sophisticated machine learning models for estimating the stochastic discount factor (SDF) based on various financial factors/features, including ESG factors.
2. Explainable AI models that explain and trace how different factors, including ESG and climate risk factors, impact the expected return of assets.
3. ESG and climate risk factors and how they influence asset performance at company, sector and market level, including construction of transparent ESG indices that allow benchmarking of portfolios.",Næringsliv,Næringsliv,14000000,Alberto Guillén Jiménez,NORQUANT AS,Oslo

Cancer diagnostics and pathology are essential to provide the best treatment for the patient, but are facing three major challenges: 1) there is a lack of pathologists; 2) intra- and interobserver variation among pathologists are significant, potentially causing suboptimal treatment; 3) tumour heterogeneity implies that single samples from tumours often is insufficient to properly assess relevant tumour characteristics, causing inaccurate predictions. The DoMore! Lighthouse Project, funded by the Norwegian Research Council in 2016-2021, addresses these challenges by implementing methods for in silico pathology, i.e. automated analyses of pathology samples scanned with high-resolution scanners. A neural network-based method for automated prediction of patient outcome in colorectal cancer has been validated in a cohort of 1122 patients, providing large and treatment-relevant separation of patients with good and poor prognosis. Similar systems are under development for lung and prostate cancer. Additional inventions include a mitotic cells counter, with high counts indicating worse prognosis. Furthermore, we have initiated a project on automatic histological classification of bowel polyps, relevant to countries with bowel cancer screening programs and limited pathology resources. The challenges intended to be met by this project is to further support a planned prospective clinical trial, to implement a standalone module for the colorectal cancer classifier, to develop image standardisation modules for scanner types and tissue samples, to develop a prototype decision support system integrating information from the new markers with existing information and to ensure appropriate dissemination of results to primary users, such as pathologists and oncologists, to build confidence in the methods.",Helse Sør-Øst RHF,Helseforetak,4966000,Håvard E.

309611,Large scale single step genomic selection in practice,2020,2024,"Summary:
Norwegian breeding schemes have traditionally been based on large-scale collection of practical data. The advance of novel automated electronic recording systems further increases the data volumes coming from practical herds. However, these practical data come often with imperfections and many missing records. In the context of modern genomic selection breeding schemes, especially ungenotyped animals and thus missing genotypes cause biases and inaccuracies of breeding value estimates. A first major objective of the current project is to develop genetic evaluations for cattle and pigs that make seamless use of genotyped and ungenotyped animals, and other patterns of missing data. A second major objective is to develop algorithms that can handle massive amounts of practical records, including the ever-increasing numbers of animals genotyped with ever-increasing marker density. Also, a software package implementing the novel algorithms will be developed. A third major aim is to combine records on practical and elite breeding animals to pinpoint important genomic regions for the traits of interest, in order to maximize the accuracy of the genomic breeding value estimates. Statistical, animal breeding and machine learning approaches will be combined to tackle these objectives. The above challenges are faced by both the cattle and pig breeding industries and they thus join forces here to address them. By an increasing use of practical information, GENO and Norsvin aim to genetically improve the characteristics of the animals that are important under practical circumstances. Hence, making the animals better adapted to perform under practical conditions and thereby improve the sustainability of the cattle and pig production sectors.",Næringsliv,Næringsliv,8500000,Janez Jenko,GENO SA,Hamar

Decisions,  regarding how this data should be coded rely on a semi-automated and interactive decision support system, named as Cancer Registration Support System (CaReSS). The system uses a patient’s test results and treatments, and makes decisions, based on medical coding rules, often using machine learning. CaReSS evolves due to, e.g., addition, deletion, and modification of rules due to new treatments, improved diagnostics, new medical results and tests, and new diagnostic standards. Also, CRN continuously updates CaReSS with advanced versions of machine learning algorithms. Thus, the implementation of CaReSS undergoes continuous change and warrants continuous, cost-effective testing of CaReSS as it evolves. A well-test CaReSS will prevent the system from producing inaccurate statistics and data to its end users. Inaccurate or imprecise data produced by CaReSS have significant adverse effects on the scientific results produced by researchers. Also, inaccurate or imprecise statistics produced by the CaReSS will significantly impact the decisions made by patients, hospitals, and policymakers. The innovation planned is a state-of-the-art test infrastructure including new testing techniques to support cost-effective and systematic testing of the CaReSS to significantly improve its quality, and quality of data and statistics it produces, by dealing with the continuous evolution and unpredictable behavior of machine learning algorithms.

309660,Trygg og energioptimal autonom seilas,2020,2023,"Innovasjonsprosjektet skal utvikle en generisk løsning for trygg og energioptimal autonom seilas for skip i sjøgang ved ulike driftsmoder. Prototypen skal testes på linefartøyet MS Geir for å effektivisere operasjonen og minske skade og tap av fangst. 

Prosjektet skal se på løsninger for å automatisk optimalisere lastfordeling, rorbruk og propellstigning/rpm under ulike driftskondisjoner slik at motor og propell opererer på optimalt driftspunkt. Settpunkt blir i dagens system i dag satt ut ifra forhåndsdefinerte kombinatorkurver for spesifikke kondisjon(er). Typisk er noen få kurver implementert, og operatøren må selv bestemme når det skal byttes mellom kurvene. 

Innovasjonsprosjektet skal utvikle ny metodikk for etablering av optimal lastfordeling mellom propellere, optimal rorbruk og optimale kombinatorkurver som inkluderer hybride fremdriftssystem, miljøkrefter, dragkrefter fra fiskeredskap og batterienes ladestatus. Løsningen skal gi automatisk regulering av lastfordeling, kombinatorkurver og kraftkilder basert på utviklet metodikk, algoritmer og løpende målinger. Løsningen skal inkludere kobling mot navigasjonssystem herunder automatisk kurskontroll.

Løsningene skal implementeres i et styringssystem for autonom seilas. Løsninger for å forbedre hastighet og kurskontroll inkluderer bruk av måledata fra thrust, dreiemoment på aksel og krefter fra vinsjer. For linefartøy vil små forbedringer i hastighetsstyringen kunne gi store utslag under setting av line, der man med jevnere hastighet reduserer tap av agn og dermed øker fangst per kWh. 

For å oppnå tilstrekkelig tillit til komplekse programvarebaserte styrefunksjoner som støtter eller tar over oppgaver til kompetente operatører, kreves det testing der styresystemet utsettes for ulike scenarioer. I innovasjonsprosjektet skal det utvikles konsepter og løsninger for simulatorbasert testing, inkludert generering av scenarier og evaluering av resultater.",Næringsliv,Næringsliv,13240000,Sigrid Marie Mo,BRUNVOLL AS,Molde

In SmartForest a series of enabling technologies (drones, remote sensing data, sensors, machine data, robotics, blockchain, and digital twinning) are deployed in the forest sector, leading to innovations, improved efficiency, and new business models. 
SmartForest operates with six key applications areas, implemented as work packages, for digitalization in the forest-based value chain: (1) Forest resource information: where emerging different sources of data are combined resulting in improved continually updated forest information, (2) Precision silviculture: where cost-efficient and potentially semi-automated treatments such as precision regeneration or fertilization are developed and implemented for increased growth rates, (3) Digitally-enabled forest operations:  improve production efficiency and reduce environmental impacts by applying digital tools to better plan forest harvesting, to improve machine operator performance, and ultimately to automate or semi-automate some components of forest harvesting, (4) Precision wood supply: where the value of harvested wood is maximized through optimization of sensor-generated information on wood quality throughout the supply chain, and the supply fluctuations are reduced through improved planning with new digital tools, (5) Traceability and certification: where full traceability of each log from stump to end product is enabled though application of sensors and tracking technologies and the information is utilized to improve certification procedures, and (6) The digital value chain: where new and existing digital tools and systems are connected in forming the foundation for all actors to share and access data and information, and in this way optimize the whole value chain performance.",Primærnæringsinstitutter,Instituttsektor,96000000,Rasmus Astrup,NIBIO - NORSK INSTITUTT FOR BIOØKONOMI,Ås

Det er ca. 1 mio. nødsamtaler hvert år, og tallet øker. Det forventes at AMK sine oppgaver øker både i antall og kompleksitet. Jobben er faglig komplekst og krevende, og samhandling mellom innringer og AMK er avgjørende for utfallet. Likevel finnes ingen standardisert utdanning, opplæring, sertifisering eller vedlikeholdstrening for AMK-operatører.

Automated and intelligent sensors will be used to collect data in difficult and dangerous navigation areas. The consortium has the following observation technologies available for the project: drones carrying multispectral or radar sensors, single or dual-band ship radars, in situ measurements of snow and ice, and a broad range of satellite sensors (e.g. synthetic aperture radar, passive microwave and optical) from Chinese, European and US space programmes. The heterogeneity and vast amount of data generated by these sensors requires scalable ICT frameworks to efficiently manage and extract key sea ice parameters that can be translated into useful information for Arctic shipping. The chosen technologies and tools will be co-developed together with ship operators with extensive knowledge of navigation in Arctic regions. Specifically, we will apply novel machine learning techniques such as deep learning for automatic detection of riskful conditions. The derived data products will be organised in a data management system and distributed to targeted user groups using standard protocols and communication networks. We will demonstrate the developed data collection, management, analysis and distribution services through case studies targeted at the Arctic shipping industry. Each case study will be co-developed by scientists, local authorities and shipping companies and result in new data products and visualisation services for supporting safer Arctic shipping.

The target system based on the project findings will be cloud hosted and OMS- and related applications can be generated automatically from generic plant information models (digital twin patterns). One OMS related field which is presently often neglected, is the preparation of data, prior for applying artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) methods. A lot of companies and methods has been created for AI/ML purposes. The methods planned to be developed in this project is almost a prerequisite for the success of such applications.

R&D challanges targeted in the SkyTrack project are:
- To classify plants into types that can be represented by similar digital twins.
- To find algorithms and methods for automatic or semiautomatic transformation of signal names (tags) and parameter names in plant databases into SkyTrack digital twins names.
- To find methods for automatic generation of plant models into digital twins.
- How to optimize the user interface to enable end users and system integrators to configure and realize cloud based OMS based on basic information models and automatic application generators.

An innovative solution for precision imaging in radiology",2020,2024,"Recent years have seen exciting applications of machine learning in medical data analysis, from radiology and dermatology to electronic health records and drug discovery. This has led to great interest and enormous expectations from the medical profession. However, it is still early days for the evaluation and integration of artificial intelligence and machine learning-derived information in clinical practice. This proposal addresses one of the crucial missing elements required for implementation and integration in clinical radiology: an innovative, direct integration of computational imaging methods with picture archive and communication systems (PACS). To ensure the usefulness of our innovation, we will apply it to two of the most important health challenges in modern society: cancers in women (uterus) and men (prostate).

We aim to 

i) Integrate routine radiology workflow with research infrastructure for computational image analysis.

ii) Apply and evaluate this enabling technology on a large collection of imaging and clinical data from a cohort of 600 gynecologic cancer patients treated at Haukeland University Hospital since 2009. This will be done using novel, deep-learning based approaches to segmentation for ROI-based information extraction (""radiomics""). 

iii) Investigate how well our innovation generalizes to other computational medical imaging methods and to different applications, and explore how our framework can best be embedded in clinical PACS and HIS/RIS systems.

Such an ambitious endeavor is particularly timely and feasible due to the recently established multidisciplinary center MMIV at Haukeland University Hospital.

There are devastating consequences, in terms of both patients and their families, as well as overwhelming healthcare expenditures with costs for the Norwegian economy of more than EUR 12 billion yearly. Existing and emerging cardiac devices and medications have the potential to significantly improve or even cure serious cardiac conditions. Advanced ICT tools are essential in modern medicine and their use increase rapidly. However, current diagnostic tools and decision support systems fall short in characterizing and profiling individual patients’ disease progression. 

We propose a new Precision Health Center for cardiology (PROCardio) that will develop, test and validate new tools that can reliably predict an individual patients’ disease progression, estimate risk of sudden cardiac death and provide a longitudinal view of past and future care pathway options enabling optimal disease treatment. In particular, the opportunity to make use of cutting edge technology such as artificial intelligence, has the potential to make critical breakthroughs in the treatment of CVD.

The expected impact of the PROCardio centre is spread across a wide range of stakeholders, including commercial companies in ICT and healthcare industry, but most importantly to patients, healthcare providers and payers.
PROCardio will enable better and earlier detection of heart disease across the spectrum of cardiac disease by multi-modality monitoring, use of novel techniques including artificial intelligence and machine learning.

In 2017 the cybersecurity market was worth more than US$105 billion, but it is projected to reach US$259 billion by 2025.

Originating from the Norwegian Biometric Laboratory (NBL) at NTNU, a cross discipline team of researchers have developed novel and accurate algorithms proven theoretically, to detect child predators and people with fake profiles online. The algorithms are based on machine learning approaches within the fields of keystroke dynamics and stylometric behaviour and they form the fundament of the AiBA risk analysis solution. The aim of AiBA is to provide warnings of suspicious or potentially harmful activity in real-time. Initial testing has achieved a higher accuracy than state-of-the-art solutions.

The commercialisation strategy of the project is to start a venture funded spin-off company that will get access to the  technology through an exclusive license agreement. The business idea of AiBA is to offer an accurate and real-time solution for detection of fake profiles and child predators online to social media and gaming companies, through API license agreements. API licenses are a common and well proved model within the industry.

309936,The intelligent decision-making process for hydro scheduling,2020,2022,"In this project, Norwegian hydropower producers will take a significant step towards the goal of a wholly automated hydro scheduling system. Instead of improving or replacing any existing optimization tools, the attention will be paid to the way that these tools are used for advanced decision support. This project will focus on the pre-setting of the executive commands that are called to run the optimization tools. 

At present, no matter how sophisticated the optimization tools are, the hydropower operators have to manually set up the executive commands before running the optimization models. Though various solution methods or heuristics have been developed and are free to use, limited by human analytic competence, the operators prefer to choose the commands they are familiar with or directly adopt the default setting. These commands are only set up once before optimization and valid for all the hydraulic objects (i.e., reservoirs, plants, hydro-turbine generator units) and the entire scheduling horizon. 

The planned innovation of this project is to replace the current manual setup of commands with the automatic allocation of commands depending on the specific operating and market conditions of the given hydro system. This automation will be achieved by integrating modern machine learning techniques with a comprehensive understanding of the hydro systems and optimization models. 

This project pioneers a brand new decision-making process for hydro scheduling. It stretches out the application of the optimization tools to a broader decision-making level, from a uniform scheduling tool to a customized intelligent scheduling system. If successful, the methodology developed in the project can be applied to a wider context, not only limited to hydro scheduling, since almost all the advanced decision support tools designed for large-scale problems confront such a similar challenge as the pre-selection of suitable executive commands.",Næringsliv,Næringsliv,2000000,Jiehong Kong,SKAGERAK KRAFT AS,Porsgrunn

We are now ready to expand, both in Norway and internationally. However, further research is required to overcome some key challenges: 
- Behavioral change challenge: How do we change consumer habits? Which factors make people shift from buying to renting, or from throwing away to lending out? What is important for retailers to lend out? 
- Sustainability challenge: How can we optimize our business model from an environmental point of view, while still being scalable and financially viable? How can we minimize footprints from our own value chain, while at the same maximize our impact for sustainable clothing consumption? 
- Technical challenge: Can artificial intelligence and machine learning help create a superior user experience that makes renting more attractive than buying? How can we build a sharing platform that meets the requirements of the value propositions designed and the complex logistics of a peer-to-peer sharing platform?

We are proud to partner with three leading universities, BI, NMBU and UIA to solve these challenges.",Næringsliv,Næringsliv,23535000,James Larsen,FJONG NORGE AS,Oslo

310001,Optimal risk based short term decision making for aquaculture.,2020,2023,"Salmon farming is by its nature an operation with significant uncertainty along several axes involving a number of risk factors (sea lice, disease, low oxygen, etc) that all can have a major impact on production. Towards the end of the production cycle stock value is at the highest level. At this point fish density will normally also be high, which reduces safety margins related to environmental factors like temperature and oxygen levels. High average fish weight implies increasing physiological challenges to individual fish with corresponding increase of mortality risk, especially in relation to operations like sea lice treatment. 

Optimal harvest planning must bring all these elements into consideration, along with downstream dispositions like wellboat availability, harvesting capacity, market demand development. Harvest planning involves important decisions with high potential impact on profitability and are based on complex considerations. Paradoxically short term harvest planning is today performed manually supported by internally developed spreadsheets. We aim to develop a decision support tool for analyzing potential risk related to alternative operational dispositions, and for providing specific and precise support for optimal harvest planning.",Næringsliv,Næringsliv,3700000,Penelope Melgarejo,OPTIMEERING AQUA AS,Bergen

Samtidig vurderer disse flyplassoperatørene dagens løsninger som uegnet  til dette formålet. I dette prosjektet vil vi ta eksisterende drone og sensorteknologi og utvikle systemer for autonom deteksjon av avvik fra de krav en flyplass har til sikker drift. Dette vil omfatte en rekke sikkerhetskritiske elementer innen flyplassdriften.  Fremmedlegemer (FOD) på operative flater, vilt og fugl, skilting og lys. 
Det er ingen effektiviseringsgevinst ved å la en driftsoperatør sitte å overvåke video fra en drone i sann-tid. Vi vil utvikle og demonstrere systemer som detekterer sikkerhetsavvik automatisk fra overvåknings data som samles inn. Disse vil bli basert på ny, men velprøvde metoder fra maskinsyn og maskinlæring. Videre vil vi lage systemer som automatisk genererer hendelses rapporter inn til flyplassens  drift og sikkerhetssystemer. 
Alle kommersielle droner er avhengig av satellittnavigasjon (GPS). Selv om dette kan gi en posisjonsbestemmelse med centimeter nøyaktighet, utgjør dette en sårbarhet. Midlertidig bortfall av GPS signaler for en drone som følge av radioskygge fra bygninger, eller i form av radiostøy (jamming eller spoofing) kan medføre farlige situasjoner med risiko for personell og materiell. Autonom, nøyaktig og sikker navigering nær strukturer for inspeksjon inne på et flyplassområde vil derfor kreve navigasjonssystemer som er robust for korte eller lengre bortfall av GPS signaler. I prosjektet vil vi forske videre på teknologi fra NORCE for sikker navigasjon av droner som ikke avhenger av GPS.
Videre vil vi se på operasjonelle prosedyrer og løsninger som muliggjør droneoperasjoner på en slik måte at de ikke påvirker flyplassens ordinære drift.",Næringsliv,Næringsliv,5350000,Stian Andre Solbø,OPSCOM SYSTEMS AS,Bodø
310027,Enhancing Reservoir Characterization by Applying Machine Learning,2020,2023,"Oil and gas (O&G) companies spend considerable time and resources to identify and evaluate prospects before they drill an exploration well. ReservoAIr combines geological and geophysical methods with machine learning (ML) techniques to enhance reservoir interpretation quality and efficiency. The novelty of ReservoAIr is to combine prediction of sands based on generated geomorphological features in synthetic seismic with the prediction of lithology (rock types) derived from well logs and partial stacks (angle dependent seismic amplitudes) to predict reservoir sands and enhance reservoir characterization. In order to validate and train the sand prediction, ray-based seismic modeling will be used to generate synthetic seismic. Qualitative validation of the ML model predictions will be performed by industry partners and by the modeling approach of the synthetic seismic. The project partners will develop an interactive human-machine feedback loop allowing geoscientists (users) to improve the underlying ML models. 
The most optimal networks and methods for detecting sand deposits and lithology will be utilized. RagnaRock's proprietary techniques of predicting horizons and faults will be used as the starting point for this research. ML models are only as good as the data they are trained on. Utilization of diverse training data sets, together with the consortium of domain expertise in both ML and geoscience, lays the foundation for ReservoAIr to exceed the reliability, usability, and performance of recently presented methods. ReservoAIr will leverage ML’s superior ability of pattern recognition with abundant amounts of data, guided by cross-disciplinary geoscience expertise, to extract information not apparent to the human eye. ReservoAIr represents a new end-to-end workflow for reservoir characterization, enabling O&G companies in faster and more informed exploration decisions, saving them millions in exploration.",Næringsliv,Næringsliv,8995000,Åsmund Heir,RAGNAROCK GEO AS,Oslo

310098,Increasing the impact of supermodelling climate research in Norway,2021,2022,"The International Panel of Climate Change is preparing its sixth assessment report on climate change, and at the same time private and public sectors demand predictions of regional climate for the next few years. Climate models are essential to both. Despite great advances, climate models suffer from large systematic errors that cause large uncertainties in predictions of regional climate change on short and long timescales.

The ERC STERCP project has developed a super climate model to reduce model error. A super model combines the benefits of different models in an interactive manner to outperform the individual models; and to outperform the standard approach of combining the output of independent model simulations. We have created a super model based on three different state-of-the-art climate models, and we are now refining the super model and conducting climate change simulations with it.

Super modelling is a new concept that is currently developed only at the University of Bergen. The concept stems from theoretical nonlinear-dynamics and relies on advanced machine learning algorithms. NorSuper will create awareness of this concept in the non-academic world in Norway, as well as internationally. We will develop outreach material for high-school students and the lay person, but also for those who utilize climate services. The material will be available via a project website, but also through the Bjerknes Centre’s communication channels.

NorSuper will increase the uptake of our super climate model data by Norwegian and International scientists through holding two workshops. These will synthesize current research on regional climate change and climate prediction.  We will use these to show case the super model concept as an approach to advance these two fields. Through leading international publications on these topics we will achieve greater recognition of H2020 research conducted in Norway and increase visibility of climate researchers in Norway.",Universiteter,UoH-sektor,864000,Noel Keenlyside,Geofysisk institutt,Bergen

The project will develop intelligent defect detection and predictive structural integrity assessment tools to support decision-making during various phases of a piping lifetime. The corrosion resistance alloys (CRA) topside piping will be focused. The most critical R&D challenges include the development of 1) acceptance criteria for topside CRA piping, 2) defect detection and classification methods, 3) predictive structural integrity assessment method and 4) engineering tools for engineering critical assessment (ECA). The project will investigate the damage mechanisms of materials under different conditions (e.g., loading and environment), and thus establishing acceptance criteria for assessment of defects. The PAUT method will be further developed for defect detection especially in CRA piping. The digital solutions like machine learning, database and models will be applied to develop engineering tools to support decision-making related to predictive life extension. Finally, the innovation will be demonstrated by relevant industrial case studies such as decision-making regarding repair during piping production. In today's piping production, weld defects are not acceptable, which often leads to unnecessary and expensive repair.

In addition to improving quality of life, access to inclusive education can help equip locals with the tools required to develop innovative solutions to the world's greatest problems. The question is therefore how to improve learning, within the opportunities and constraints of the UN's sustainable development goals, and at the same time streamline and facilitate the learning process both for the student, a possible lecturer and the learning institution.

As stated in Myers and Myers (1980), though, ""One of the great frustrations of teaching is that you are always robbing Peter to pay Paul"". When designing an education program to reach one group of students, lecturers know that in so doing they are going to turn off another group. Most lecturers have experienced that diversity is upon us. Textbooks taking this into account, i.e. adapting to the knowledge and personality of the reader, should therefore facilitate and improve the learning process (""the meshing hypothesis"").

Terp has the goal to accomplish this in cooperation with our collaborators The Norwegian Computing Center and University of Stavanger by utilising a new concept of learning material; the a-book.

The core challenge of inspecting pipes is the limited access to the inner pipes. Additionally, the pipes may be either filled with water or air which require a different set of sensors.  We will develop a multimodal combination of a high-resolution ultra-wideband impulse radio (UWB-IR) radar and ultrasonic transducers (UT) that provides full circumferential (360°) see-through capabilities from inside pipes filled with either air or water. The high-volume data achieved will be analysed by advanced signal processing and visualization algorithms in combination with machine learning algorithms providing not only visualization of the pipes, but also identify internal fatigue on the lattice structure and detect different types of deficiencies with precise geographical position. 

The service of pipeline inspection for industries such as water & wastewater and hydropower is called upon in relation to both construction and maintenance of pipelines. Hence, the market potential for a pipeline scanner such as ROMUS is closely related to the construction and maintenance market for these industries. A report published in 2017 by Norwegian Water BA estimates the municipal investment needs in water & wastewater infrastructure till 2040 to be approximately NOK 280 billion in Norway alone, whereby NOK 183 billion, or about NOK 7.3 billion per year, are in renewal of water & wastewater pipelines.

310197,Towards an Explainable AI in Manufacturing,2020,2021,"Industry 4.0 corresponds in a way to the digitization of the factory. Through the use of the Internet of Things and cyber-physical systems, the intelligent factory is characterized by continuous and instantaneous communication between the various tools and workstations integrated into the production and supply chains. 

The use of communicating sensors provides the production tool with a self-diagnostic capacity and thus allows its remote control, as well as its better integration into the global production system.

This project aims at the development of artificial intelligence techniques in contexts where humans and artificial intelligence together control systems and make decisions. The topics we would like to address are related to two scientific directions: sharing of control, involving in particular automated planning, multi-agent systems, and man-machine interaction; and sharing of decisions, involving in particular machine learning, knowledge extraction, and data analysis, with a privileged application in manufacturing.

The common concept that appears in this proposal is the one of explainability of artificial intelligence systems. In fact, artificial intelligence technologies, as machine learning, neural networks and deep learning, are applied in many different areas, and also in production and Industry 4.0. These techniques have proven to be powerful providing decisions and solutions in situations that have not been possible to carry out before. However, the AI-based systems are considered to be black boxes and it is difficult to follow the AI-systems reasoning, as well as investigate how they reached their conclusions.

310239,3D shape analysis of cattle to improve data collection,2020,2023,"To improve genetic gain within cattle breeding, relevant data need to be collected on a large number of animals. However, for some traits, data collection requires a lot of manual work, and automation of these processes has the potential to both save costs and improve the genetic gain. Examples of such traits are weight measurements on beef cattle (where the cattle needs to be located on the weight) and udder conformation on dairy cows, which is currently scored by visual inspection by technicians. Geno, TYR and other collaborators are now in another project testing out whether use of 3D cameras in combination with computer vision could replace traditional recording systems.
Main objective: In this project, we want to develop automatic computer vision algorithms that utilize the surfaces to predict geometric properties relevant for the cattle breeding. Reference data sets are under constrcion, where both 3D images and traditional recordings are taken from the same animals. Based on computer vision and machine learning techniques (like e.g. supervised deep learning), we aim to train regression models that could be used to predict relevant phenotypes, based on 3D images. 
• Secondary objective1: Develop models to predict traditional udder conformation traits, based on 3D images. Traditional conformation score data and predicted traits from 3D images should be used into genetic analyses for comparison and estimation of e.g. heritability.
• Secondary objective 2: Develop regression models that are able to predict weight, carcass-quality and body condition score from 3D images of cattle, taken from above.
• Secondary objective 3: Develop new relevant traits for breeding. To do this, we aim to build a reference atlas of the udder surface to achieve point correspondence between individuals.

Human activity monitoring is a well-established field but is mostly based on approaches which are inconvenient and intrusive. Sleep stage monitoring also relies on Polysomnography, which is conducted in hospitals or sleep labs, and the patient is required to wear several sensors. It is not yet known if the same level of results and accuracy can be achieved using machine learning algorithms with data collected from non- intrusive sensor. This thesis will, therefore, explore the potential of (R1) predicting the sleep stages using single non- intrusive sensors with deep learning. More specifically:   
•    Relate sleep stages from EEG data to the sensors implemented during the research.   
•    Model the dynamics of the sensor readings to sleep stages and stage transitions.     
R2: Detecting mental and emotional stages 
Emotion recognition from biometrics is relevant in a wide range of application domains including healthcare. Monitoring the emotional stages could be useful in identifying concerned behavior before they become serious. In this thesis, we will (R2) detect mental/emotional stages (using deep learning algorithms), which are precursors to suicide attempts from the patient behavior and vital signs by using non-intrusive sensors. More specifically:  
•    We need to collect data by interviewing the psychiatric nurses/doctors to find out what tell-tale signs they are looking for while observing the patients on the suicide watch.   
•    We need to model the behavior of the patients in conjunction with vital sign monitoring to detect the critical stage which requires intervention.

Hva som er den mest hensiktsmessige håndtering av feil blir en vurdering av ulike tiltak sett i lys av sannsynligheten for feil og hvilke virkemidler man har tilgjengelig. Gitt kompleksiteten av moderne kraftsystemer er dette et svært omfattende optimeringsproblem. Tradisjonelle optimeringsmetoder vil generelt være tidkrevende. Hovedidéen i dette prosjektet er å benytte maskinlæring generelt og såkalt forsterkende læring (engelsk: reinforcement learning) spesielt for å raskt å finne best mulig håndtering av feilhendelser som oppstår i kraftsystemet.

Forsterkende læring er en agent-basert tilnærming til maskinlæring. I en slik tilnærming kan man tenke seg en agent som modellerer systemoperatøren, og som iterativt lærer og forbedrer driften av nettet i ulike tilstander. Dette synes å være en lovende tilnærming til hvordan man kan drifte et stadig mer komplekst system, samtidig som beregningsomfanget holdes på et håndterbart nivå.

Anvendelsen av dyp, forsterkende læring innenfor kraftsystem er i startfasen og det blir derfor essensielt å utforske og kartlegge hvilke typer algoritmer som er skalerbare til hele eller deler av det norske kraftsystemet. På grunn av lange regnetider for å trene disse modellene er såkalte GPU-er (graphics processing unit) blitt en helt nødvendig del av maskinvaren. I lys av dette vil et viktig forskningsspørsmål være å utforske GPU-akselerasjon.

RE-AIMED will explore how to improve the communication with the caller and the operator's workflow by using artificial intelligence to suggest relevant questions which are sensitive to the context, and to identify medically significant patterns by analysing questions and answers. Choice of relevant questions and answers will help the operator to document the conversation in real-time. To provide context-specific suggestions, an ensemble of methods that not only analyses content, but also considers multiple characteristics like the pace of the conversation, have to be applied. As the medical urgency of reasons for contacting medical call centres are skewed, with few urgent cases, further research into new ways of overcoming imbalance-problems in prediction of minority classes is needed to ensure that rare, but serious,
medical cases are not missed. Real-time documentation will demand new ways of using an intelligent user interface to require only a minimum of input to select appropriate questions, so that the operator can concentrate on the
caller.

Automatic documentation will generate large data sets of standardised and detail-coded descriptions of medical calls. The collected data will be a rich source for research on telephone triage, medical decision making, communication and reduction of biases in machine learning.",Nasjonale samfunnsvitenskapelige institutter,Instituttsektor,15975000,Ingrid Hjulstad Johansen,NORCE Samfunn/Helse VESTLAND,Bergen

While the prevalence of such diseases, especially chronic ones, is rapidly growing, the methods of the initial examination – with a stethoscope – have barely changed. Inadequately carried out examination or drawbacks of subjective interpretations lead to unnecessary referrals to more advanced and costly tests, delayed diagnose or increased severity of the condition, leading to poorer treatment, rising hospitalization times and related cost, and most importantly, having detrimental effect on person’s health.

Newly developed “digital” solutions, even those trying to move into AI area, have added new device features which either compromise the user experience and workflows, have little added clinical value, or both. 

Medsensio has developed a cloud-based platform for automatic detection of abnormal breathing using deep learning. The company is specializing in AI algorithms for breathing analysis using world's largest annotated dataset of lung sounds   and is planning a Horizon 2020 collaboration with 2 potential partners with complementary backgrounds across the value chain: one in medical device development at TRL 7 who aims to integrate with Medsensio platform, and another with network of marketing and sales channels to reach the market. 

Horizon2020 project would support achieving maturity of the combined solution with an end-to-end integration, clinically and economically validating its value at pre-commercial KOL-level for successful market introduction and full commercialization.

We are developing a platform and an application programming interface (API) that enables our customers to discover new knowledge from vast amounts of data. The core foundation of our data processing platform is a knowledge graph. At is core it’s an expression of how the enterprise world is connected - a graph of entities, represented as nodes, connected by relations. By analysing and adding millions of multilingual documents through this graph daily, it becomes an evolving and self-learning structure that, in real-time, represents what is going on in the world, enabling our customers to react in due time to relevant and business critical events. Our context relevance system uses state-of-the-art machine learning to assess the relevance and impact of each event. Compared to our competitors, our system is able to leverage its self-learning capabilities with much less training data. Currently we are working closely with several pilot customers in developing a solution that helps sales representatives keep and maintain customers. In addition, our solution is able to detect commercial risks in the current portfolio of customers.

In the SME phase 2 proposal the main objective is to further develop our data processing platform, including API, and explore additional verticals besides sales support.

Selve prosjektet:
The EXSCALE project will stand on three pillars:
1. First, a resource- and location-aware computing toolkit that implements dynamic resource management to facilitate deployment on resources of arbitrary architectures (CPU, GPU, FPGA, ASIC) at any network levels (fog, edge, cloud, dedicated).
2. Second, novel machine learning algorithms for distributed unsupervised online learning, upgrades to existing algorithms towards excellent multi-node scaling, and exploitation of recent advances in, for example, Deep Learning, to extract new insights from extreme-scale distributed streams.
3. Third, tools for automated critical-time decision support and visualization even in the face of extreme numbers of high-velocity data sources.

While EXSCALE will be completely generic, its development will be driven by use-cases from three industrial sectors: energy, finance, and remote/moving sensing. These impose realistic, demanding, and critical requirements on the core aspects of deployment, processing, and decision making. They there therefore uniquely suited to validate the system.

The EXSCALE project is structured into 9 work packages (WPs) with the following responsibilities:
# Title Description

Perspektiver fra Martin Heidegger sin tenkning om menneskets væren og eksistens vil bringes inn – i særdeleshet hans tanker rundt teknologien (teknikkens) betydning for det moderne mennesket – for å undersøke om det åpenbarer seg noen tydelige, etiske spørsmål som kan og bør belyses sterkere når teknologien i vår tid i større og raskere grad utvikler seg fra å være et verktøy til å bli en mer autonom form for teknologi. Når teknologien blir en mer integrert og en usynlig “forlengelse” eller “utvidelse” av menneskets væren og “befintlighet” i Heideggersk forstand - hva skjer da? Hva gjør teknologien med oss? På hvilken måte kan dette være etisk problematisk?

Avhandlingen vil undersøke  hva den digitale transformasjonen kan føre til når informasjonsteknologien og utvikling av kunstig intelligens har nådd et punkt der AI er både et formidabelt verktøy og samtidig et formidabelt våpen. Det trengs nye, bevisste tilnærminger for å lede teknologiske virksomheter i vår tidsalder som fremover blir definert av kraftfulle nyutviklinger som AI. Selskaper som skaper teknologi må også ta på seg et større ansvar for fremtiden.
PhD-prosjektet skal bestå av fire artikler (inkludert en kappe), bruke andvendt filosofi og kvalitativ metode som forskningsmetoder. Prosjektet skal romme et kvalitativt case fra Sparebanken Sør. Avhandlingen vil skrives på norsk, det vil lages en engelsk abstrackt.

This project will leverage the PIs’ unique combination of expertise at the crossroads of biology, bio-sensor interface design, and wireless communications, to address the challenges for human health applications such as prediction and prevention of infections. 

CLIPEUS (Shield in Latin) aims at creating a communications network among man-made implantable devices and the natural cells inside the body under the novel communication paradigm, called Internet of Bio-NanoThings, where sensing, actuation, and computing processes are tightly coupled to pervasively, perpetually, and precisely sense, process, control, and exchange health information of the body in real time to defend it against infections.  

CLIPEUS focuses on the detection of infections inside the body based on the detection of the molecular communication among the infectious bacteria by man-made bio-nanothings, called GLADIO (Sword in Latin), consisting of bionanosensors for detection, low power electronics for processing and antenna for near field communication to transfer the data through the tissues to outside of the body. Due to the power limitations of GLADIO, the inherent noise of biological processes, and the non-deterministic response of patients to infections, the collected data will be sparse and noisy. Novel machine learning techniques will be developed to interpret this data for future personalized medicine applications. The system will be extensively tested and ameliorated by phantom experiments as a first step before in vivo experiments.

310628,Anomaly detection combining time series and unstructured data using Artificial Intelligence algorithms in a cloud/edge device scenario,2019,2020,"QBee was founded in 2017 to help industrial IoT companies managing their embedded Linux devices. Ensuring distributed Linux IoT devices are secure, updated, connected and remotely accessible is a challenge, especially when they are from different vendors, and when there is a mix of old legacy units with new ones. qbee.io is a unique platform that is vendor agnostic and does not require software development or containers, thus saving time and costs to IoT companies regarding internal software development and manual configurations. Our platform addresses many IoT verticals such as industry 4.0, smart cities, sensor networks, vending machines, measurement equipment, etc. We operate towards devices manufacturers and system/devices integrators or operators. 

QBee aims to improve the current existing minimal viable product. Besides monitoring metric data, configuration data, communication patterns, Linux system behaviour, etc, it was identified the need of an accurate anomaly detection feature. Thus, it is critical to our product to include intelligent algorithms to detect automatically anomalies and thus ensure a secure and efficient maintenance of the connected devices. QBee aims to develop this critical feature from scratch to be the first player in the market offering a reliable solution with low false positive detection rate. 

QBee does not possess in-house expertise in machine learning for time series or unstructured data analysis, that is essential for this project. We are looking to recruit an Innovation Associate with the required skill set, in order to complement our team. The SME Innovation Associate programme is thus necessary for QBee to initiate R&D activities with a view to positioning QBee as a top player in large scale management of IoT devices. Acquiring these skills is thus fundamental for QBee to keep and extend its competitive advantage over the coming years and will allow QBee to outgrow into a forefront innovation player at global scale.",Næringsliv,Næringsliv,200000,Carsten Lehbrink,QBEE AS,Nordre Follo

Our dedication and entrepreneurial spirit have enabled us to develop the world’s first avalanche prevention device which attaches to skis, and monitors and detects snow layers in real-time. This innovation will revolutionize avalanche management for skiers and companies monitoring snow and forecasting avalanche risk. Our R&D activities financed through the Norwegian funding scheme Research-based Innovation (BIA) and supported by experts from leading research centres SINTEF and NGI, enabled us to advance current snow monitoring technology and adjust it to meet the needs of skiers and avalanche forecasters worldwide. We have conducted two small-scale pilots with industry partners from both the ski and hydropower markets. 
TO is developing a ground-breaking solution consisting of a small, robust and well-designed sensor that can be attached to nearly any ski and a supporting application. This system provides real-time insight about the snowpack and avalanche risk. Our highly innovative technology enables skiers, snowboarders, ski patrols and many other actors in the industry to monitor the snowpack for risk. Unlike any other avalanche-preventive solution, our technology maps the snowpack in real-time, and gives warning signals to the user if a weak layer is detected. The collected data is then shared on the application to benefit all other interested parties. The technology is based on machine learning (ML) that analyses data obtained from the sensor in order to define each snow layer´s structure and identify potentially dangerous layers.",Næringsliv,Næringsliv,47000,Monica Vaksdal,THINK OUTSIDE AS,Bergen
310720,Tolkning av geotekniske feltundersøkelser ved bruk av maskinlæring,2020,2023,"Geoteknikk omhandler hvordan jord og stein kan brukes som byggeteknisk materiale. Kunnskap om grunnens mekaniske egenskaper danner grunnlaget for forebygging mot jordskred samt prosjektering av fundamentering av alle typer konstruksjoner. For å kartlegge stedlige grunnforhold i enkeltprosjekt utføres grunnundersøkelser, dette både i felt- og i laboratoriet.

Manglende deling av data om grunnforhold var ett av punktene som ble trukket frem i Stortingsmelding 15 (2011-2012) «Hvordan leve med farene - om flom og skred», og som svar på dette lanserte NGU i 2013 en nasjonal database for grunnundersøkelser (NADAG). Der kunne foretak laste opp sine grunnboringsresultater, som siden ville bli gjort tilgjengelige gratis via webportal. Statens vegvesen driver sin egen grunnundersøkelsesdatabase (GUDB), som synkroniseres med NADAG. Inkludert boringer fra GUDB inneholdt NADAG i Januar 2019 registreringer fra over 100.000 borehull.

Statens vegvesen har gjennomført et pilotprosjekt som har vist at en enkel maskinlæringsmodell kan trenes med grunnundersøkelsesdata for å identifisere kvikkleire og sprøbruddmaterialer direkte fra trykksonderingsdata. Dette gir bedre detekteringsnøyaktighet enn bruk av jordartsidentifikasjons-diagrammer som tidligere har vært brukt til dette formålet.

Dette prosjektforslaget er en videreføring av pilotprosjektet, der store mengder grunnundersøkelsesdata skal undersøkes ved bruk av maskinlæring med studie av sonderingsdataene alene, samt  å knytte registreringer fra ulike sonderingsmetoder til fysiske materialegenskaper i samme posisjon målt i laboratoriet.

311085,MP: Real-Time Accurate Measurement of Placental Volume by Ultrasound,2020,2021,"Over the last 10–15 years, it has been established that disproportionate placental size relative to fetal size is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. However, since this knowledge is relatively new, placental volume measurements are not part of the standard prenatal examinations today. The only established method for such measurements during pregnancy is MRI imaging. However, this is both expensive and time consuming and thus not feasible as a part of the standard examinations. Many researchers have tried to estimate placental volume using ordinary 2D and 3D ultrasound, but none of them have validated these estimates against a gold standard such as MRI before. Our findings suggest that these techniques are not accurate, probably mainly due to the large size and variable geometry of the placenta.

The aim of this project is to develop an algorithm based on machine learning for automatic analysis of 2D ultrasound images to accurately measure placental volume and to verify the method on real data. This algorithm can also be applied to other imaging needs using only 2D ultrasound. Development of valid measurements of placental size in ongoing pregnancies will enable the identification of pregnancies with high risk of adverse outcome that we cannot identify today. Such identification is necessary for preventive interventions and can thus potentially improve maternal care and reduce fetal death rates all over the world.",Næringsliv,Næringsliv,500000,Inge Hovd Gangås,SINTEF TTO AS,Trondheim

311117,ERA-NET: Personalized Atrial fibrillation Risk of Ischemic Stroke assessment (PARIS),2020,2023,"Atrial Fibrillation (AF) is a complex cardiac disease characterized by chaotic electrical activation and loss of atrial contraction, which creates a hemodynamic environment that is prone to clot formation and a six-fold increase in risk of ischemic stroke. AF is gaining epidemic proportions and currently affects more than 6 million Europeans, with an annual cost exceeding €13.5 billion, and the number of patients expected to double by 2030. The majority of AF patients are prescribed anticoagulants that markedly reduce stroke incidence, but at the  cost of increased risk of severe bleedings. Individualized anticoagulation management remains a major challenge, and current risk scores for stratifying stroke and bleed risk (e.g. CHA2DS2-VASc, HAS-BLED) show poor performance. The current risk scores are based on  population-level statistical correlations only, do not account for the underlying mechanisms of clot formation, and routinely available patient-specific clinical data are under-utilized. Computational models of the atria have reached a high level of sophistication, and include advanced statistical representations of atrial morphology and motion, as well as biophysically detailed models of tissue- and fluid dynamics. Model-based tools for diagnosis and prediction are emerging, but remain insufficiently validated and tested to be used for individualized clinical predictions. PARIS will utilize existing medical records of AF patients with known clinical outcome, to tune and validate computer models and predictive machine learning methods in an iterative process. The resulting decision support system will be validated retrospectively by predicting individualized disease outcome in a matched case-control cohort. The ambition is to identify biomarkers that  correlate with stroke, bleeding and other severe complications, and to prospectively outperform the current risk score to reduce individual bleeds by optimizing personalized treatment and clinical follow-up.",Øvrige forskningsinstitutter,Instituttsektor,4195000,Kristian Valen-Sendstad,SIMULA RESEARCH LABORATORY AS,Bærum

The group has several projects ongoing related to ICT and funded over IKTPLUSS, and this workshop will benefit those projects.
The workshop program will consist of presentations and poster sessions, where participants can present recent and ongoing work. Participants that would like to present their work will be asked to submit a two-page abstract or a full six-page paper. Additionally, there will be a panel discussion, where issues and recent developments in the field will be discussed.
We have invited 5 high-profile keynote speakers. This will contribute to the quality and also increase the visibility of the workshop. However, this also leads to expenses, such as plane journeys and hotels, that need to be covered. We estimate these costs to be 40 000 NOK.
In addition to this, we will use the conference organizing company Xtenso AS, who will provide help with setting up registration (e.g. credit card payment, budgets). Overall, we estimate a total of 95 participants, which would result in an overall direct cost of 200 KNOK.
To cover these costs, UiT The Arctic University of Norway contributes with 44KNOK (40 hours at an hourly rate of 1100,- NOK) of Jenssen's and Kampffmeyer's salary.

Recently, next generation sequencing has caused a step-change in our understanding of the ecology and evolution of marine plankton. However, plankton are still largely under-represented in biogeochemical and Earth System Models, including those used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The poor representation of plankton diversity in these models impairs our capacity to accurately anticipate the impact of climate change on plankton-mediated ecosystem services. Next generation sequencing also provides a huge quantity of data, which opens unprecedented opportunities for developing new machine learning tools for ""big data"" mining. Hence, there is a crucial need for training a new generation of innovative early stage researchers (ESRs) at the interface of key scientific disciplines such as marine ecology, 'omics' (genomics and transcriptomics), numerical modelling, climate sciences and data science, including artificial intelligence.

311287,Digital Building Twins for Construction Site (DiCoSiMa),2019,2020,"Digital twin for real time monitoring of building production: state and quality assessment supporting dynamic re-planing enabling reduced production cost with improved production quality. 

1. The production planning is always a challenge while environmental have a big influence.
Monitoring of the construction progress on the construction site with autonomous vehicles equipped with cameras. A drone inspects, for instance, the fire seals in building modules and the water sealing of roof elements to protect the building against rain already in the early assembly phase. The construction progress will be monitored with image recognition together with water sensors (e.g. create models based on images and derive progress information) and will be compared with the initially agreed planning. 

2. The monitoring of the location of each single worker and of smaller and larger equipment would help to optimize the resource efficiency with forecasting and deep learning algorithms. That would mean:
· Lower idle time of trucks and reduce the time that building modules stay idle on the construction site. Use of satellite data for the localization  of the modules.
·Safer work condition while workers get warning signals when cranes move loads in their working area
·Monitor the health of smaller equipment (e.g. envelops for building modules) and use a forecasting when envelops need to be replaced.

3. Very often it the real costs status of a construction building is not clear for all parties involved. The creation of more cost sensitivity would help to reduce the construction costs. This will lead to a better information base for decisions and to well informed actors in the factory and on the construction site.

311341,Doctor AI2 – Artificial Intelligence mining of the Adaptive Immune system to develop an immunodiagnostics platform,2021,2023,"Early diagnosis of disease is key to optimal treatment and in terms of diagnosis, our adaptive immune system is the “best doctor”. It carries out diagnosis with unmatched precision before clinical symptoms arise. There is a gold rush in academia and industry to develop artificial intelligence (AI) methods that exploit our immune system’s capacity to assist doctors in everyday diagnosis.

The adaptive immune system records each past and ongoing battle with disease. This immune memory is recorded by “immune receptors” - short genetic sequences specific for each disease. Immune receptors can today be sequenced at high-throughput. We have previously shown that similar immune receptors (similar: identity of entire genetic sequence or subsequence) arise in different individuals when faced with the same disease. Thus, the pattern recognition capacity of machine learning may be leveraged to detect disease-associated patterns in the genetic sequences of immune receptors. However, so far, machine-learning-based exploitation for immunodiagnostics of immune receptor sequence datasets has been rather poor. This is due to (1) a lack of machine learning approaches that can exploit the unique biological characteristics of immune receptor repertoires, (2) and a lack of ground truth data for machine learning benchmarking.(3) There exists currently no platform for the machine learning analysis of large-scale immune receptor datasets.
To resolve these knowledge gaps, we propose to develop novel AI methodology and implement a comprehensive software platform for immune receptor-based diagnostics. To validate our framework, we have access to the world-wide largest experimental and synthetic immune receptor datasets.

In the medium-term horizon, the transdisciplinary project Doctor AI^2 will move the research frontier in AI techniques for immune-receptor immunodiagnostics and contributes to the AI revolution in medicine by supporting clinicians in therapeutic decision making.",Universiteter,UoH-sektor,8752000,Geir Kjetil Sandve,Institutt for informatikk,Oslo
311350,Functional imaging for individualized cancer treatment,2020,2020,"In gynecologic cancer there is an immediate need for accurate preoperative tumor assessments to safely individualize therapy. Overtreatment of early stage disease and poor survival in metastatic disease partially relates to lack of predictive preoperative imaging markers. Gynecologic cancer patients prospectively subjected to preoperative imaging by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) / computed tomography (CT), are studied to identify novel imaging biomarkers relevant for prognosis and treatment. In parallel tumor tissue of the same patients are analyzed for genetic and molecular markers in relation to clinical findings and outcome. 
Furthermore, the research group has recently established orthotopic mouse endometrial cancer models derived from cell lines and from patient derived biopsies. These models will be studied by optical imaging, MRI and PET-CT during disease progression. Functional imaging characteristics will be explored in these animal models and studied in relation to corresponding molecular characteristics of the tumor. 
The research group has extensive experience with preoperative imaging in the context of clinical trials and tissue markers in gynecologic cancer. This research platform allows for novel comparison between advanced functional imaging findings and genetic, molecular, metabolic and angiogenic characteristics of the corresponding tumor tissue. Building on previous experience, the current project will explore functional imaging findings in gynecologic cancer in patients and in animal models in relation to stage, outcome, and genetic and molecular tumor markers. The overall aim of the project is to provide improved imaging tools with which to identify high-risk patients and disease progression, and thus facilitate better individualized treatment, reduced morbidity and implementation of targeted therapy in gynecologic cancer patients.",Ukjent,Annet,500000,Ingfrid H.

311393,Analytics for computation and visualization of liver resections,2020,2024,"Liver cancer is one of the most common types of cancer and its incidence is increasing. Surgical resection is the only curative treatment for some types of cancer. For nearly two decades, surgeons have been employing computer-assisted planning systems (CAPS); these systems show an increase of precision in surgical planning and an improved orientation and confidecne of the surgeon during operation. Despite these benefits, CAPS have found difficulties to Reach the clinical practice (the most noticeable is the problems to generate 3D patient-specific models from images). With the introduction of AI in medical imaging, these problems have been greatly reduced. This has created a new scenario where 3D patient-specific models are going to be systematically generated for its use in surgical planning and guidance. This new reality is perfect for the introduction of liver analytics and AI in surgical planning for the improvement of liver surgery practice.

The main problems that can benefit from the introduction of AI and liver analytics are: (1) the difficulties for generation of resection plans in difficult cases (e.g., multiple metastases)—this proces is still manual—; (2) the standard division of the liver in segments (largely used for resectio planning) does not pose a wide consensus in the medical community, and therefore, there is the need to investigate new methods that can computationally generate different types of vascular territories; and (3) there are no formal methods to specify and communicate resection plans—clinicians are currently using subjective descriptions (written or oral), hand-drawings and pictures taken from the surgery, and therefore, there is a need for investigating visualization techniques able to capture the critical information contained in a resection plan in a formal way that can be interpreted by any clinical expert.

Animalia har, de senere årene, vært med å utvikle objektive metoder for klassifisering av slakt av storfe, rein og sau.  Prosjektet skal øke presisjonen i klassifiseringen, styrke tilliten til resultatene for både slakteri og produsent (bonde), samt å redusere kostnader.  De objektive klassifiseringsmetodene skal tilfredsstille EU sine krav til presisjon.
For storfe (og rein) settes den objektive klassen ut fra slaktets vekt og lengde, samt andre kjente opplysninger om slaktet slik som kjønn, alder og rase. For fettmålingene hos storfe er et operatørstyrt system basert på mikrobølgeteknologi under utvikling. 
For sau har prosjektet MeatCrafter utviklet et helautomatisk instrument som bestemmer klasse og fettgruppe. Evaluering av instrumentets presisjon og stabilitet er en viktig del av OBKLAS.

Our dedication and entrepreneurial spirit have enabled us to develop the world’s first avalanche prevention device which attaches to skis, and monitors and detects snow layers in real-time. This innovation will revolutionize avalanche management for skiers and companies monitoring snow and forecasting avalanche risk. Our R&D activities financed through the Norwegian funding scheme Research-based Innovation (BIA) and supported by experts from leading research centres SINTEF and NGI, enabled us to advance current snow monitoring technology and adjust it to meet the needs of skiers and avalanche forecasters worldwide. We have conducted two small-scale pilots with industry partners from both the ski and hydropower markets. 
TO is developing a ground-breaking solution consisting of a small, robust and well-designed sensor that can be attached to nearly any ski and a supporting application. This system provides real-time insight about the snowpack and avalanche risk. Our highly innovative technology enables skiers, snowboarders, ski patrols and many other actors in the industry to monitor the snowpack for risk. Unlike any other avalanche-preventive solution, our technology maps the snowpack in real-time, and gives warning signals to the user if a weak layer is detected. The collected data is then shared on the application to benefit all other interested parties. The technology is based on machine learning (ML) that analyses data obtained from the sensor in order to define each snow layer´s structure and identify potentially dangerous layers.",Næringsliv,Næringsliv,28609,Monica Vaksdal,THINK OUTSIDE AS,Bergen

While the prevalence of such diseases, especially chronic ones, is rapidly growing, the methods of the initial examination – with a stethoscope – have barely changed. Inadequately carried out examination or drawbacks of subjective interpretations lead to unnecessary referrals to more advanced and costly tests, delayed diagnose or increased severity of the condition, leading to poorer treatment, rising hospitalization times and related cost, and most importantly, having detrimental effect on person’s health.

The project GEObyIT addresses needs of two departments of the Oslo municipality. The Emergency Department requires improved capabilities for infrastructure monitoring and detection of unusual events such as accidents, explosions, and crimes based on data collected in line with the General Data Protection Regulation that prohibits usage of “sensitive data”. The Water and Sewage Department is currently involved in building a tunnel for securing the freshwater supply in Oslo. This requires improved mapping of surface features and monitoring for small earthquakes or other events which might be able to affect water flow paths. GEObyIT will address both needs by producing new layers of information based on seismic, acoustic, and remote sensing data, which will help to quickly locate incidents and other urban events, ready to be integrated into the existing alertness plan of the city, and to identify and classify potentially hazardous features on the Earth’s surface. While the employed data sets are different in nature, each serves the purpose of risk assessment and the proposed automatic processing pipelines will use a common methodological approach based on Machine Learning. The final product of GEObyIT will be tools for urban real-time alert and risk assessment, including hazard maps for predictive and operational purposes and a dashboard-like webpage including real-time location maps of events. This concept of providing novel data layers for future city management is extremely ambitious, but there is a huge potential to yield major gains and radical breakthroughs, including knowledge transfer and applicability on the global scale.

SmartFit will facilitate the process of personalization and manufacturing upper limb prosthetic sockets by creating a digital platform enabling to digitalize and automate the process of custom tailoring prosthetic arm sockets. Hereto, we plan to build a dynamic 3D model of the patient’s stump using smartphone cameras combined with advanced deep learning methods for accurate 3D surface reconstruction.

This opaqueness can pose limits on involving humans in shaping, operating and monitoring the arrangements in place ensuring meaningful human control. The responsible use of AI entails ensuring algorithmic intelligibility and accountability. Intelligibility means that algorithms in use must be intelligible as to their state, the information they possess, their capabilities and limitations. Accountability means that it is possible to trace and identify responsibility for the results of algorithms. Both are required for using algorithms under human oversight. The AI4Users project will contribute to the responsible use of AI through the design and assessment of software tools and the formalisation of design principles for algorithmic accountability and intelligibility. 
The project takes a human-centred perspective addressing the needs of different groups implicated in AI-infused public services: citizens, case handlers at the operational level, middle managers and policy makers. The novelty of the AI4Users is that it targets specifically non-experts extending the reach of research beyond AI experts and data scientists. The use cases to be employed by the project will address different oversight scenarios including human-in-the-loop, human-on-the-loop and human-in-command.

311714,Towards Artificial Intelligent Maintenance System (AIMS) via Predictive Failure Modelling and Numerical simulation,2020,2023,"Safety of marine constructions is fundamentally dependent on corrosion control by protective coatings and their maintenance. Coating maintenance is expensive and has safety challenges. To determine the optimal time to perform coating maintenance is difficult since several issues must be considered at the same time, like economy, logistics, safety without compromising the integrity of the construction or the safety workers. Intelligent decision support systems (DSS) will aid the maintenance optimization. The introduction of sensor- and drone photo monitoring enables intelligent predictive maintenance systems and decision support systems also for coatings. This process can become even more effective if predictive simulations can forecast coating degradation and corrosion induced damage. Sensors and automatic inspections are now being introduced and deliver (computationally) useful information. Key to the success of this revolution is that information can be extracted from the data. Developing sensors, computational models, software tools and AI for this purpose is the technical objective of this project.
The project consists of four main technical developments:
· Laboratory investigation of correlation between environmental parameters and coating degradation to fill the holes in our current understanding
· Development of acoustic sensors for monitoring coating degradation. Inspection of atmospheric coatings is achieved by photo, aided by drones, which is known technology
· Development of a neural network (AI) for analysing sensor data, picture data and simulation data on coating degradation · Development of a model to predict the coating degradation rate and corrosion from the current state, and future need for coating maintenance

Our ambition is to become a global provider of insight related to the sales and distribution of wine and beer by providing a solution that enables more data-driven decision-making for the global brewery-industry. Data from «Tap.IT» will facilitate more transparency through the value-chain (brewery distributer end-user), where we will generate customer-value by providing more predictable operations by using real-time consumption-data in operations related to planning of sales and maintenance. Our product-solution proposition is based on in-depth knowledge of the industry through years of working as a supplier of draft beer-equipment and running a bar. Through our network we have performed several in-depth interviews of potential customers in order to gain more insight about the nature of the problems that needs solving. From the customer-dialogue the project-team have identified issues food-safety and product-quality due to the lack of maintenance of tap (draft) equipment. In combination with “state-of-the-art” knowledge about micro-controller units (MCUs) and Machine Learning the project team is confident in providing the customer a cost-effective solution that will generate value from day one. During the Forny-project period the focus will be on industrialization of the sensor-solution in collaboration with partners and establish a beachhead-market in the brewery-segment through extensive testing with pilot-customers (attachment - letters of intent ) we hope to prove a marked-product fit.",Næringsliv,Næringsliv,1000000,Balder Klanderud,TAP.IT AS,Oslo
311864,STUD: Disputas - A platform for analysis and critical reflection.,2020,2021,"Understanding patterns, and training students to automatically see them, is the most important objective of courses in analytical subjects. For many forms of analysis, the relevant patterns are much easier to grasp if they are displayed visually. Therefore students today still use pen and paper when engaged in these forms of analysis. 

With knowledge from philosophy and informatics, the project group aims to make an interactive digital environment for textual analysis, supporting visualization in the manner students and professors currently do with pencils and sheets of paper. We would also like to employ the data generated from these analyses to develop innovative machine learning technology. 

The main aim of the project is to develop a functional platform for analysing text. The biggest challenge is going to make analysis intelligible, fun and engaging to students through a digital medium. 

The team is comprised of three students of informatics with different skill-sets. Anders has a deep familiarity with machine learning methods in language technology, and is currently writing a masters degree on machine analysis. Andreas has experience as a fullstack developer and has made webapplications from scratch before. He is also familiar with modern UX design. Paal has a masters degree in philosophy, and has a deep familiarity with linguistics and logic. The team is motivated to work on the project because they believe it might help the public debate climate, and because they think the idea might be the backbone of a new generation of machine analysis services. 

The academic institution helps with relevant expertise and a work environment through insj. 

The support from Forskningsrådet will be used to develop an MVP that will be refined throughout the project period. This will result in a fully functional platform by the beginning of the fall semester of 2021.",Næringsliv,Næringsliv,1000000,Anders Næss Evensen,DISPUTAS AS,Oslo
311887,E!113703 Seismic Horizon Artificial Intelligence Regeneration,2020,2022,"SHAIR will create a new software service that will deliver highly accurate interpretation of seismic data to determine the likely presence of oil or gas.

We will achieve this by a novel Machine Learning implementation that combines two known but disparate tools. The output of each tool can be used as the input of the other tool, so by looping round we can produce more and more accurate results, cancelling out noise and errors to continuously improve accuracy of results. (See Fig. 12 Annex)

RRG's technology currently contains an AI driven horizon interpretation with minimal human interpretation. It takes in migrated stacks in the time domain. It uses their improved Geophysics-guided Neural Networks (GNNs) innovation of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to detect discontinuities in the rock structure, and interprets these as 'horizons'.

S3's Technology, XWI, is the result of 20 years development covered by many patents. It is an advancement of traditional Full-Waveform Inversion (FWI). It produces high quality 3D Velocity models in assessing shallow anomalies.

The main result will be a novel suite of tools available to oil companies as a SaaS product via which the companies will pay to more accurately analyse their data.

The new technology will combine S3's XWI technology making use of velocity models to better constrain the automatic interpretation done by RRG's GNN. Pre-processed and migrated data will be the inputs for the AI interpretation.

The main result will be a new service using our experience to date of ML to create a service that would be more cost effective for oil companies than the traditional method of analysis to discover oil. Oil companies will become more profitable via better analysis and a higher rate of success. This improved interpretation of data should reduce the likelihood of drilling of oil or gas which results in none being found and therefore can help the environment and waste of such incidents.",Næringsliv,Næringsliv,3375000,Åsmund Heir,RAGNAROCK GEO AS,Oslo
311891,BlueBio - Optimizing land-based fish production in next generation digital recirculating aquaculture systems,2020,2023,"Recirculating aquaculture systems (RASs) have been developed for land-based production of sea- and freshwater species. These systems are designed to provide high biomass production while reducing resource usage and maximizing control of operational parameters. However, only a few of these parameters are systematically monitored, and currently applied analysis techniques are often insufficiently sensitive, slow or laborious. Consequently, the full potential of RASs for more sustainable food production remains unexploited. The over-all goal of the DIGIRAS project is to develop innovative and data-driven solutions for digitalization of future RAS technology in order to increase environmental compatibility, fish health and productivity. The project intends to reach this goal by systematic acquisition of relevant water quality data, parameterization of fish behaviour, developing new biological and chemical sensors and efficient water treatment technology. DIGIRAS will strive to integrate all generated data towards decision support and predictive tools for next generation digital RAS operation. In DIGIRAS, R&D institutions with strong competence in (micro)biology and chemistry, fish health, video monitoring/machine learning, modelling and water treatment technology will join forces with industrial partners from the fish farming and RAS technology sector. Together, this consortium will contribute to improve land-based fish farming technology significanlty, with respect to animal health, production conditions, environmental benefits and sustainability. Moreover, DIGIRAS aims at contributing to more sustainable growth in the aquaculture sector by developing new technologies, and thus, generating new jobs in infrastructurally less developed areas in Europe.
In DIGIRAS, 6 R&D institutions and 5 industry partners (1 external contributor) from 5 participating European countries will collaborate for 36 months with a total funding budget of 1.68 Mio € (project budget 1.94 Mio €).",Teknisk-industrielle institutter,Instituttsektor,6480000,Roman Netzer,SINTEF OCEAN AS,Trondheim
311902,Sensor Validation for Digital Twins of Safety-Critical Systems,2021,2024,"The project shall develop a systematic framework for sensor-fault detection, isolation, and accommodation by forcing a paradigm shift towards the development and the integration of signal processing and machine learning methodologies into novel hybrid-analytics solutions. Building upon ground-breaking concepts from graph signal processing, deep learning and transfer learning, SIGNIFY shall design and test tailored strategies from a Bayesian perspective to be used as tools for sensor validation when importing data from physical assets into digital systems.
Designing optimization strategies exploiting real-time real-world data from sensors is one main value from the digital transformation. Unfortunately, sensors are prone to failures and injection of corrupted data into digital twins generates erroneous planning. When operating in closed loop, erroneous planning may lead to consequences ranging from performance degradation to lack of safety and risk of danger. The need for a validation tool before injecting sensor data into the digital twin is urgent in safety-critical applications. 
Among relevant areas, Industry 4.0 focuses on development of safety-critical systems, where the high level of accuracy is needed when validating sensor data. In these systems it is hard to predict a malfunction by looking at the data without prior knowledge of the underlying phenomenon. Results from SIGNIFY will be general enough to apply to a large variety of scientific/application domains, however during the project 2 uses cases within the Industry 4.0 framework will be considered: 
(UC1) Flow Assurance for CO2 Transport Operations;
(UC2) Low-Temperature CO2 Liquefaction and Phase Separation for Carbon Capture.
The facilities selected will allow the integration of physical models to benchmark sensor data and fit the Bayesian approach employed in SIGNIFY to combine signal processing and machine learning techniques.

In just 2 year since we identified the pains in the claims handling process, we have developed and tested a proprietary AI-driven engine that uses computer vision and a set of machine learning techniques to automatically identify and appraise car damages and provide highly accurate cost report. Our pioneering solution will radically transform the claims handling process for insurance companies, auto repair shops and claimants. It is an end-to-end solution that also has the flexibility to easily integrate into any legacy system. The engine is a cloud-based, white-label SaaS. Unlike any competitor, our use of 3D imaging ensures we can provide automatic accurate cost reports (parts and work hours) based on surface and internal damage instantly. Our edge-based app solution uses the camera and accelerometer to guide the claimant through the image capturing process.  Claims handling is critical for value creation within an insurance company due to its significant impact on loss ratio, cost ratio and the overall customer experience – the 3 most important factors affecting industry profitability. Nevertheless, insurance claims handling systems are outdated, inefficient, costly and subjective. The current claims handling process is further cumbersome, tedious and complicated for all players in the value chain. 

The 24 month WAIT project will involve involve 4 main development areas.

1) Three distinct MVPs;
a. improving the appraiser engine with techniques to create digital car damages for enhancing Ai-algorithms
b. develop full solution for garage mode 
c. develop a fixed setup (rig) for 247 access to the public to perform car damage assessment

311993,Precision Medicine Interventions in Alzheimer’s Disease,2020,2022,"AD is a devastating and incurable brain disorder causing the majority of dementia cases. AD is defined by common biological criteria and develops on a biological continuum where the disease course includes preclinical periods and starts long before dementia appears. Genetic risks and disease pathways differ between AD subgroups and precision-medicine (PM) approaches are required to develop successful interventions. The PMI-AD consortium will exploit our world-leading technologies and competences to stratify early-stage AD patients using novel mechanistic pathway-to-therapeutic algorithm to develop cost-effective, pathway-adapted diagnostics and early interventions to delay disease onset. We hypothesize that PM can be delivered based on optimized diagnostic tools utilizing innovative pathways and prediction modelling. PMI-AD will focus on Innate Immune (Ii)- and Synapse (S)-related genetics that are tightly coupled to AD risk and are frequently manifested as distinct phenotypes early in the disease. We will employ integrated clinical scores, Ii and S polygenic scores, fluid (blood, cerebrospinal) and MRI biomarkers in advanced statistical modelling using machine learning and deep-learning techniques for Ii and S pathway- and stage -stratification. Furthermore, we will test candidate substances in established experimental models (incl. patient-derived neuron-microglia cultures), to stratify patient groups and perform early therapeutic interventions. Early-stage and pre-clinical trials require use of focused medical nutrition and repurposed drugs with established safety profiles. We will perform cost assessments of health and care-impacts, and trans-European implementation. PMI-AD partners are world-leaders in genetics, biomarker development, machine learning, clinical trials and health economy.

311994,Ubiquitous Connectivity via Autonomous Airborne Networks,2021,2024,"While households in developed countries receive skyrocketing data rates through optical fibers and smartphones step into the 5G era, roughly one half of the world’s population cannot connect to the internet. Even beyond developing economies, the entire humanity would benefit from the capability of bringing data connectivity to areas where it cannot currently reach since it would drastically benefit applications such as the internet-of-things, smart agriculture/forestry, wildfire suppression, search-and-rescue missions, paramedical interventions, and emergency response handling to name a few. 

To address this need for ubiquitous connectivity, the 3GPP consortium, which develops the 5G standards, is regulating the integration between satellites and communication unmanned aerial vehicles (C-UAVs) to combine the benefits of the former, which provide low data rates in large areas, and the latter, which provide high data rates in smaller areas. C-UAVs are balloons, zeppelins, or multicopters with an onboard relay or base station that provides internet access to ground users by connecting to satellites, terrestrial base stations, or other C-UAVs; see Fig. 1.

For this technology to become a reality, key technological developments are still required. Particularly, existing systems are oblivious to the propagation conditions of each location. Instead, they rely on statistical characterizations of average scenarios that fail to capture the specifics of each propagation situation. This proposal targets a comprehensive set of algorithms and procedures for C-UAV systems to govern navigation and communication where the decision-making is aware of the radiofrequency (RF) environment and the user conditions. More specifically maps of the propagation channel are constructed based on measurements collected by ground users, C-UAVs, and (possibly) satellites. These maps are then utilized by C-UAVs to navigate and place themselves at positions with favorable propagation conditions.",Universiteter,UoH-sektor,12445000,Daniel Romero,FAKULTET FOR TEKNOLOGI OG REALFAG,Kristiansand

Increased customer demand, customization and personalization of products require integrated processes and increased utilization of robotics and smart machines. Use of machine learning and AI is important for developing the business models. At the same time as technology can make traditional manufacturing smart and even more efficient, it also opens up possibilities for businesses to set up advanced production at a fraction of the cost known from traditional manufacturing, thus making production of sustainable personalized products for a local or regional market a possibility. 

The ultimate goal of the industrial system must be to work within the ability of the planet to offer its raw materials of energy, water, material etc. The alternative cannot be sustained. What trend future manufacturing will follow also depends on the availability of a skilled workforce and working for traditional manufacturing companies without a clear purpose is not on the priority list for new employees. A transition from linear to circular models for both goods and services should be focus throughout the process.

312045,Intelligent systems for personalized and precise risk prediction and diagnosis of non-communicable diseases,2021,2024,"This project will create intelligent systems for personalized and precise risk prediction and diagnosis of non-communicable diseases using multi-omics data, by developing, implementing and validating novel algorithms for structure learning and inference in large-scale, multi-organ causal Bayesian gene networks, based on computational methods that we have developed previously to infer, characterize and validate gene regulatory networks in complex diseases.

Risk prediction algorithms are used to identify high-risk patients for early intervention to reduce the premature mortality from non-communicable diseases,  but we have yet to discover models that can integrate the tens of thousands of data points that can be measured by omics technologies in a single drop of blood.

To distinguish causation from correlation in multi-omics data we will develop non-parametric models for causal inference between tens of thousands of variables.

To link multi-omics causal networks from multiple organs to disease states we will develop novel algorithms for large-scale Bayesian network structure learning.

To create intelligent systems for risk prediction and diagnosis of non-communicable diseases that only use blood-based measurements we will develop efficient methods for inference in large-scale Bayesian networks.

To implement a proof-of-concept application in cardiovascular medicine we will apply newly developed methods on a unique resource of multi-omics data from more than twenty thousand Nordic individuals to which the project will have privileged access.

This project is an international and interdisciplinary collaboration in bioinformatics, systems biology, computer engineering, machine learning and cardiovascular medicine that will deliver a well-validated and scalable platform to create intelligent systems for personalized and precise risk prediction and diagnosis of non-communicable diseases that will identify high risk individuals more accurately than existing methods.",Universiteter,UoH-sektor,12807000,Tom Luk Robert Michoel,Institutt for informatikk,Bergen
312062,ML4ITS - Machine Learning for Irregular Time Series,2021,2024,"Time series data are ubiquitous. The broad diffusion and adoption of Internet of Things, and major advances in sensor technology are examples of why such data have become pervasive. These technologies have applications in several domains, such as healthcare, finance, meteorology and transportation, for solving related tasks on time series. Deep Neural Networks have recently been used to create models that improve on the state of the art for some of these tasks. 
In some scenarios obtaining a training set that matches the feature space and predicted data distribution characteristics of the test set can be time consuming, difficult and expensive. Thus, there is a need for focusing on modern AI techniques that can extract value from small and irregular data. These considerations can also contribute to conform with the increasing need to address the sustainability and privacy aspects of ML and AI.
The goal of this project is to overcome the issue of limited available or labelled data in the time series domain, where the heterogeneity of the data, e.g. non-stationarity, multi-resolution, irregular sampling, poses a further challenge. ML4ITS's main objective is to advance the state-of-the-art in time series analysis for 'irregular' time series data (see explicit definition of 'irregular time series' in the proposal). We plan to achieve these goals and tackling the 'robustness' challenge,  by developing novel A) Transfer Learning and B) Unsupervised learning and Data Augmentation methods. These techniques have hardly been explored in the time series domain. 
We relies on a multidisciplinary study combining different perspectives from the three main scientific communities involved in time series analysis.

There is a strong need to direct AI applications towards solving Arctic challenges that are important for Norway and the world (e.g., marine pollution or irresponsible exploration of ocean resources in the Arctic). This is no longer a stand-alone IT and/or IoT challenge. 

This workshop is first of its kind in Norway. It will bring together a rare combination of skilled experts from different fields with a passion for IKT, science, engineering, Arctic, and who are motivated to learn across disciplines to address Arctic challenges including data acquisition and quality, marine pollution, overfishing, irresponsible ocean exploration, unsustainable utilization of ocean space among others.

However, the digital transformation continues to frustrate and burden users, citizens and customers.
The Smart Journey Mining (SJM) vision is to support successful digitalisation by extending the research front in process mining and service science with recent advances in formal analytics and artificial intelligence. The overall goal is to develop a theoretical fundament and a process analytics framework based on formalized user journeys.
Process mining allows organisations to reverse-engineer their business processes by analysing digital traces left in information systems. However, process mining as a research field does not have a profound user focus, and new methods and tools are needed. We will develop a theoretical foundation and prototype tools to capture and transform user data of varying granularity levels into a semantic user journey database. This will form the basis for developing user journey analytics at three levels: (1) a descriptive level for discovery and monitoring; (2) a predictive level for anomaly detection and possible behaviours; and (3) a prescriptive level for pre-emptive problem solving and service recovery. This SJM Analyser will be a tool for user-centred process analytics and simulation. By involving two service providers, the analytics will be validated against empirical investigations of the user experience in realistic service environments.
SJM will provide researchers and analysts the necessary methods and tools to work across backend systems and detect patterns in vast volumes of user data. This will inform novel guidelines for the successful digitalisation of services. The SJM results will be made available to academia, industry and the public sector, thus supporting improved service quality in our society.",Teknisk-industrielle institutter,Instituttsektor,15839000,Ragnhild Halvorsrud,SINTEF DIGITAL,Trondheim
312212,Development of AI-based support tools for Emergency Medical Service telecommunicators to enable faster and more precise diagnosis,2020,2020,"The Norwegian SME Headroom LifeScience is the developer of next-generation simulation technologies. In the proposed RIA project, we will, together with European Emergency Medical Service (EMS) centres, universities and technology developing small and large enterprises, develop and demonstrate AI-based tools to support EMS telecommunicators.
When a citizen calls the official European emergency number, 1-1-2, they expect prompt, professional, and accurate help. The primary job of an EMS telecommunicator is to convey an interview that ensures structured dissemination for determining ambulance responses and pre-arrival instructions, e.g. cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), as quickly as possible. Often the situation is classified as critical and, due to the inherent ambiguous nature of human conversation, it might be difficult for the caller to communicate an adequately detailed timeline of events and symptoms. This in turn makes it very difficult for the telecommunicator to correctly identify time-critical incidents such as cardiac arrest, stroke or other incidents that needs urgent treatment. For every minute, where a patient is not being treated for a cardiac arrest, chances of survival decreases by 10%.
Today, most EMS telecommunicators are only supported by simple tools such as tree chart-based questionnaires, where a yes/no will lead to a new question. Moreover, education and training of EMS telecommunicators differ significantly from EMS centre to EMS centre. In the proposed RIA project, the consortium will develop two AI-based tools: 1) a real-time telecommunicator decision support tool, and 2) an EMS training simulator. The development of both tools is uniquely facilitated by EMS call and output data available from the EMS consortium partners. Hence, during the project, EMS call data will be safely extracted, labelled and made available for machine learning, and thus provide the basis for the AI-based tools.",Næringsliv,Næringsliv,60000,Arne Hansson Rannestad,HEADROOM LIFE SCIENCE AS,Stavanger

Although the potential positive impact of such technologies is high, SMEs are not fully aware of the business models and the ways in which they can disrupt the existing landscape of eHealth services and smart hospital procedures. As a result, designing and deploying sustainable services based on these disruptive technologies requires cross-sectoral and cross-border approaches. This includes the engaging of SMEs and multidisciplinary partners from healthcare, medical, IT and automation sectors (including stakeholders and users, if appropriate) to examine the innovation potential of emerging technologies via cross-sectoral projects by innovative SMEs to pilot the adoption and use of disruptive technologies to improve healthcare services and medical systems.

CONEMED project aims to unlock the cross-sectoral collaborative potential of SMEs by combining disruptive technologies and secured data driven business models with the health sector to deliver market sensitive and innovative solutions that enhance patient-centred work-flows delivered through the real time medical systems. By providing a framework for a more structured cross-sectoral and cross-border collaboration, that manages all the complex work-flows within the process, CONEMED instantiates the mechanisms to ensure the long-term sustainability of the action through collaborations of the participating clusters with hospitals, academia, industry, investors, business angels, managing authorities of the national innovation agencies and the European Commission support measures (such as EIT, ESIF).",Næringsliv,Næringsliv,200000,Gupta D.B.R.K.

This will be achieved by building an annotated digital archive of biological samples from the Tromsø population study. We propose a radically new approach by facilitating bottom-up metabolomics with full metabolome component annotation. The project is initiated in the context of the UN sustainable development goal: ‘Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages’. We strongly believe that coupling the metabolome onto the vast digital archives of health and diseases status, genomics, and additional well-curated big data sets in the Tromsø study, can through focused efforts open up new scientific opportunities in data-driven research on diagnostic and lifestyle markers and lead to radical breakthroughs.
The main novelties in the project include significant methodological advancements for a) rational storage and organization of metabolome big data, and b) development of a complete multi-parametric virtual analytical method to perform automated large-scale metabolome annotation and define the borders of investigated chemical space. This will require basic research on statistical machine learning combined with applied deep machine learning. 
The project will set new standards for accessibility of metabolome data to stakeholders and push the frontier for metabolomics in data-driven health research. This unique, well-organized, veracious, and readily retrievable digital archive will allow harnessing a bigger potential of Norway’s largest population study and increase its competitiveness.

312333,Predictive and Intuitive Robot Companion (PIRC),2020,2025,"PIRC targets a psychology-inspired computing breakthrough through research combining insight from cognitive psychology with computational intelligence to build models that forecast future events and respond dynamically. The systems will be aware and alert for how to best act given their knowledge about themselves and perception of their environment.

Humans anticipate future events more effectively than computers. We combine sensing across multiple modalities with learned knowledge to predict outcomes and choose the best actions. Can we transfer these skills to intelligent systems in human-interactive scenarios? In PIRC, we will apply our machine learning and robotics expertise, and collaborate with researchers in cognitive psychology, to apply recent models of human prediction to perception-action loops of future intelligent robot companions. Our work will allow such robots to adapt and act more seamlessly with their environment than the current technology. We will equip the robots with these new skills and in addition, provide them with the knowledge that users they are interacting with, apply the same mechanisms.

Studies of human perception and decision making are of special relevance to model behaviour and forecast future events and actions. This will include mechanisms for adaptive response time from quick and intuitive to slower and well-reasoned. The models will be applied in two robotics applications with potential for very wide impact: physical rehabilitation and home care robot support for older people. 

Psychology and biology have inspired several breakthroughs in artificial intelligence, such as the perceptron which underlies deep neural networks. We aim to develop similarly high-impact psychology-inspired predictive models. The unexplored nature of these models offers high potential gains, but significant risk. This is partly mitigated by the two different applications in PIRC, which help to uncover different benefits in the new methods.",Universiteter,UoH-sektor,16000000,Jim Tørresen,Institutt for informatikk,Oslo
312434,Logic-based Artificial Intelligence Everywhere: Tsetlin Machines in Hardware,2020,2024,"Tsetlin Machines (TMs) are a new machine learning (ML) approach founded on the Tsetlin Automaton. TMs use frequent pattern mining and resource allocation to extract common patterns in the data, rather than relying on minimizing output error, which is prone to overfitting. Unlike the intertwined nature of pattern representation in neural networks (NNs), TMs decompose problems into self-contained patterns, each represented as a conjunctive clause. The clause outputs, in turn, are combined into a classification decision through summation and thresholding, akin to a logistic regression function, however, with binary weights and a unit step output function. TM hardware (HW) has demonstrated up to three orders of magnitude reduced energy and faster learning, compared to NNs alike. Logic-driven fundamental blocks, organized in lean parallel processing units, are major contributors to this comparative advantage over NNs that are heavily arithmetic-based. The TM further outperforms vanilla CNNs and LSTMs accuracy-wise on well-established benchmarks. While the reported results on TMs are promising in terms of scalability, training time, accuracy, and energy, we here address three major obstacles. 1) Current FPGA and ASIC prototypes lack scalable memory elements, constraining them to small-scale ML problems. 2) Reinforcement learning (RL) is key to many ML problems, such as playing board games, however, it is unclear how to model RL in the TM framework. 3) State-of-the-art deep learning models support pre-training on unlabelled data, which significantly improves the accuracy of following supervised learning, dealing with shortage of labelled data. It is unclear how to pre-train TMs from unlabelled data. By overcoming these three obstacles we aim to architect a new TM HW/SW ecosystem that outperforms state-of-the-art ML in terms of energy efficiency and scalability, parametrised by accuracy.

Disruptive innovation has happened over and over, in industries like computing, photography, telecommunications, and retail. Technological innovations brought about by robotics, virtual reality (VR), automation, AI, 3D printing and blockchain technologies are all worth investigating, having the potential to disrupt healthcare services and ultimately improve them. Such emerging technologies, currently being used in other sectors, can also play a huge role in transforming the healthcare system and related public services. 

The accomplishment of AMBIHOSPITAL overall objectives are supported by the implantation of use-cases/pilots that will be further advanced by the projects from the third-parties supported by the funding offered through Open Calls (financial support to the third parties).

To advance the innovation activities for integrating disruptive technologies and AI solutions across the hospital value chains, AMBIHOSPITAL will implement the concept of ‘think big - start small - scale fast’ for pilots with interplay of AI and data-driven innovations. This will allow the standardisation and automation of the key processes and expand through a process of continuous improvement across various healthcare and hospital services. The results from the use-cases/pilots (some examples listed below) will contribute for realisation of efficient and interoperable solutions.

Moreover, understanding whether available pharmacotherapy options may modify the course and severity of COVID-19 infection, and the impact of the COVID-19 threat on mental health, is an impelling clinical question. 
The proposed project aims to fill these gaps by generating timely, methodologically sound evidence stemming from high-quality, detailed, and already available population-based data covering a population of over 30 million inhabitants. 
Methods and material: The project capitalizes on our access to high quality registry data in four countries, Norway, Italy, Denmark and UK, representing individual level patient data across countries with different incidences of COVID-19, and covering different types of health care systems. Design: Register-linkage cohort study with cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis to examine time trends (2018 – 2020).
Results will be incorporated in an innovative online risk predicting tool that can be used to predict individual-specific risk for severe COVID-19 infection and prognosis, which is applicable in clinical setting.

Such solutions, which was rapidly made available at the outbreak of the Covid19 pandemic, allows patients’ self-reporting of symptoms to be transferred to clinicians who follow up the progression of the disease. An existing platform for digital home monitoring of patients with chronic diseases was used, however, the situation of a pandemic poses novel demands. Our overall research question is: Which novel capabilities are required when designing home-monitoring services for forward triaging and remote care in a pandemic usage situation?. This will be answered through both evaluative and exploratory research.

We will conduct a feasibility study and an evaluation of services to provide quality assurance and identify areas for improvement. Further, we seek to establish the required infrastructural capabilities to allow capture of the unique, patient-reported, early-phase disease data coming from digitally supported monitoring. These data are valuable both for short-term optimization of the response to the pandemic, as a basis for research oriented on long-term health outcomes, and for innovative development of services. This links to the project’s further ambitions, which is to explore the possibility to combine patient monitoring services with e.g. predictive models, assistive intelligence and AI-enabled automation. We will explore the potential for innovation and improvement of the underlying ICT platform, to be able to accommodate third-party solutions and for the platform to be scalable and flexible.

The commercial approach towards privacy of the American companies and the governmental interference of the Chinese companies makes Europe’s dependence these technologies undesirable.

At the same time, the demand for artificial intelligence is pulled from the current devices that roughly equal the capacity of a laptop towards devices that have a significantly smaller footprint but a much higher prevalence. The highest benefit of using these smaller devices is found when used very close to where reality is sensed or influenced. This calls for small, low cost, distributed devices. These types of devices makes using centralized architectures, such as cloud solutions, less logical and opens the door for a paradigm switch towards distributed thinking (for example peer-to-peer, mesh).

As per the company's tagline: ""Sustainability starts with good data"". The EIC Accelerator program is targeted to accelerate both technical and commercial maturity. A strong link to the European Green Deal exists based on supporting a “healthy and environmentally friendly food system”.

Fishency has developed Fishency360, a hardware and software solution based on computer vision and machine learning to capture 360-degree views of individual fish at different depths in the cage. High-resolution images are used to detect and categorize sea lice and evaluate the quality of a sample (fish maturity, K-factor). Moreover, the images are used to measure growth and to detect early stages of fish health issues such as winter ulcers, cataracts, scale loss, and other skin damages.

Fishency has so far had two (2) full-scale prototype tests in open sea cages to prove our approach and confirm that a large fish sample swims passively through our system every day.

This gives the bank good prospects for utilizing both traditional statistical models and new machine learning algorithms. The department in which the candidate is working is one of the bank’s leading environments within customer analytics. An important part of the departments responsibilities is running a “Model Factory”, which is a framework for development of prediction models. Most of these models are used to predict which customers are interested in different products, thereby enabling personalized communication. The factory has been used for approximately seven years. During this time, there has been an immense technological development within machine learning and artificial intelligence, both in terms of new algorithms and more processing power. This makes way for implementing more flexibility in the framework in order to fully utilize the new opportunities. DNB therefore wants to support the candidate in exploring different methods for finding the optimal settings when testing different models. The starting point of the exploration will be design of experiments, as it was the theme of the candidate's Master thesis. Combining design of experiments with machine learning is a promising, but mostly unexplored terrain. Successful implementation will increase interpretability and thus responsible implementation of the models.  Different aspects of modelling can be included in the design in order to incorporate relevant challenges from the Model Factory. The results can then be used to guide further work. Better models will be beneficial for the bank as the customer contact can be made even more targeted, potentially resulting in more sales and more satisfied customers.

Hovedutfordringen for norsk drikkevannsforsyning og vannkvalitet er et gammelt ledningsnett med stort vedlikeholdsbehov, som fører til stort lekkasjetap, og kan medføre innsug av smittestoffer. Lekkasjetapet på nasjonalt nivå er 29,8%. Derfor er det nødvendig å vurdere trykkreduserende tiltak for å redusere vannlekkasjene og risikoen for brudd.

Trykket i vannledningene skal være slik at vannleveransen til forbruker skjer på en optimal måte. Derfor er vanndistribusjonsnettet delt opp i trykksoner. Per i dag er sett-trykket, ut av trykkregulerende stasjoner, stort sett statisk, og det er konstant i tid, med mindre man gjør manuelle endringer. Det vil si at sonetrykket varierer i forhold til forbruksvariasjoner, og vil dermed være høyest på natten når forbruket er lavest. Enkelte steder er dette nattrykket for høyt. Et såkalt overskuddstrykk er nødvendig å fjerne fra nettet ved hjelp av trykkreduserende tiltak.

MASKINLÆRING
Digitalisering og maskinlæring er nøkkelen til å lykkes med de komplekse problemstillingene vannbransjen står ovenfor.

313195,MP: Self-learning diagnostics and prognostics system,2020,2021,"Today, 98% of the world's ships are performing daily maintenance routines in a reactive and preventive manner. Reactive maintenance is defined as post-failure repair which introduces high risks of downtime, while preventive maintenance involves predefined maintenance intervals. Such intervals are based on the component supplier's recommendations. Since ship components are operated differently from ship to ship due to unpredictable environmental and operating conditions, they are subjected to random degradation patterns that the intervals fail to detect. Therefore, too much maintenance is performed, as a safety measure, based on the component supplier's conservative assumptions. Accordingly, today’s best practice, of regular maintenance based on predefined intervals, constitutes as much as 14% on average of the ships' total operating expenses.

Today, machine learning can be utilized to analyze the actual conditions of ship components to recommend just-in-time maintenance. The main goal of this project is to convince shipowners that a predictive maintenance system based on machine learning can provide a direct influence on ships' daily maintenance routines to reduce maintenance costs. Our self-learning diagnostics and prognostics system is based on extensive research results from Ph.D. students at the Department of Ocean Operations and Civil Engineering at NTNU in Ålesund.

This new pipeline can serve as a solution for automated reconstruction of facade models with more promising detection and prediction. Another very important reason of developing such a pipeline is that implicit urban rules are expected to be parsed by an inverse inspecting process of the deep learning network. This could help achieving the transparency in the deep learning. At the same time, it could help understanding how semantics, geometries and topology of urban objects are related to each other in a complex environment.

313592,SMB-modell: Kredittmodell for små- og mellomstore bedrifter,2020,2024,"Dette prosjektet tar sikte på å utvikle en kredittmodell for små- og mellomstore bedrifter. Små- og mellomstore bedrifter utgjør 99% av alle bedrifter i Norge, og 47% av alle ansatte i privat sektor. Totalt omsetter disse bedriftene for nær 700 milliarder kroner. Samtidig har de over de siste årene, og særlig siden finanskrisen sakket akterut i tilgangen på kapital, sammenlignet med store selskap. I 2006 utgjorde lån til SMB-er nesten 70% av alle nye bedriftsbanklån. I 2015 hadde andelen krympet til 50%, en relativ nedgang på nesten 30%. Vi tror en del av forklaringen på denne nedgangen skyldes mangel på kostnadseffektive og presise kredittmodeller og metoder for å evaluere små- og mellomstore bedrifter. 

De siste årene har mengden tilgjengelig informasjon om selskaper økt betraktelig, og utviklingen vil fortsette over de neste årene. Med utgangspunkt i denne utviklingen søker dette prosjektet å utvikle en effektiv og treffsikker kredittmodell beregnet på små- og mellomstore bedrifter. Kredittmodellen utvikles i samarbeid med Norsk Regnesentral, og skal ha som hovedma°l a° regne ut sannsynligheten for at et selskap misligholder forpliktelsene sine. 

Det unike med modellen vil være en innovativ tilnærming til hvilke variabler og informasjon som blir inkludert i modellutviklingen. Ved hjelp av NLP (Natural Language Processing) og Deep Learning og Bayesiansk statistikk kan store mengder data systematiseres og analyseres. Dette vil være særlig nyttig i vurderingen av små- og mellomstore bedrifter, hvor kvalitativ informasjon ofte er av vesentlig karakter. 

Modellen vil utvikles i tett samarbeid med kredittanalytikere, og anvendes i daglige kredittvurderinger. Det vil gi den gode forutsetninger for å kontinuerlig testes og etterprøves. Sluttresultatet forventes å øke treffsikkerheten til kredittanalyser, samtidig som tidsbruken per analyse reduseres.

Digital transformation of rural businesses is a special theme due to the complex combinations of geographical, cultural, social, technical and personal attributes, such as location, business culture, business domain, education, age, digital skills, etc., which can influence the adoption of digital technologies. In this context, the business environment of the regional business plays a vital role in supporting and enabling the stable operations and sustainable growth of the business. This includes local authorities, i.e. multicipalities, local investor network, research and development institutes and other governmental units. In any geographical case, it is important to understand the digital transformation under the influence of these contextual factors. In this proposed project, we focus: a) on an interdisciplinary theoretical development of digital transformation process for rural businesses,  b) iteratively develop a conceptual framework mapping ecosystem-level and business-level factors for performing the transformation, c) empirically evaluate the approach in a longitudinal case study.",Øvrige offentlige,Øvrige,1790000,Anders Sandvik,VINJE KOMMUNE,Vinje
313622,MP: Automated Fake News Detection,2020,2020,"Factiverse AS specializes in fake news detection and stop misinformation propagation, and the company is a spin-off from the University of Stavanger. Factiverse was established in 2020 with Validé as one of the owners, and with funding from the FORNY2020 program and Plogen. The fact checking is done using cutting edge machine learning, artificial intelligence and natural language processing techniques based on research by Prof Vinay Setty. Fake news is a major threat to society, financial markets and governments. Fake news has affected elections, caused riots and put in risk of pandemics such as SARS-Cov-2 (Covid-19). The problem in these cases are amplified because there is no easy way for people to verify information and access evidence which classifies the information as reliable or misinformation. 

To address this issue, we solve the following problem. Given a claim in the form of a textual claim. For example, ""Covid-19 can be cured by drinking bleach"" the goal is to analyse the evidence from reliable sources such as scientific journals, articles and reports to disprove this fact. In addition to classifying the fact as true or false, the goal is also to retrieve the evidence textual snippets from these sources and highlight the reasons why the claim is true or false. In this project Factiverse explores various business models, b2c or b2b:

1. B2C products include: (a) A browser extension and a mobile app where the users can fact check the news or information they are reading. (b) A VPN style service which facts checks all information that is passing through a browser or the whole system which highlights the facts which are not reliable.

2. B2B products include (a) Fact-checking-as-a-service (FAAS) which allows businesses to submit textual claims and get them fact checked. (b) Intelligent text editor for reporters and journalists (c) fact checking for financial markets, algorithmic trading and for online advertisement placement.",Næringsliv,Næringsliv,500000,Vinay Jayarama Setty,FACTIVERSE AS,Stavanger

AI and the growing role of private security, tech and consultancy companies, are reshaping policing and how we ensure social order and security, enforce law, and prevent and investigate crime. However, this ongoing radical transformation of our world is little understood. To change that, AGOPOL brings together a team of 15 established scholars and young talented researchers from cultural and area studies, anthropology, sociology, history, literature, and law and based in 9 countries, to develop a ground-breaking comparative cultural analysis of policing as a global digitized and hybrid project. Based on ethnographic research in Norway, Russia, India, Brazil, and South Africa, we will leverage comparative cross-cultural analysis and generate a novel understanding of cultures of policing – both within and beyond the police. We will analyse the impact of algorithmic governance on society and those policed – from the unintended consequences, algorithmic injustices, and harms related to these new modes of policing, to their impact on legitimacy and societal trust. Our analysis will deal with issues such as the underlying cultural conditions shaping the use of AI technologies in policing; the transformation of institutional cultures stemming from the technological change; the transformation of knowledge cultures with the increasing dominance of datafied ‘truth’; the interaction of algorithmic governance and cultures of policing; and, perhaps most importantly, the global cultural transformation as an effect of the intertwined processes of datafication, securitization, and commodification of security. AGOPOL will result in a number of scholarly publications (3 special journal issues, 21 peer-reviewed journal articles, 2 books, 16 book chapters) and events (3 international workshops, 3 international conferences), as well as a website and a series of short movies.",Universiteter,UoH-sektor,11988000,Christin Thea Wathne,Arbeidsforskningsinstituttet AFI,NA
313652,ADRIANE: Autonomous Drone system for Inspection of Industrial Assets by Non-Experts,2020,2023,"The vision for this project is to develop a fully digital process for inspection of indoor industrial assets based on an intelligent, tethered drone system that eliminates the need for human entry to confined and often dangerous spaces. The system will encompass software for smart data capture in unknown, GPS-denied environments, automatic position-tagging of indoor inspection data, AI-based detection of anomalies as well as a cloud-based system for live video streaming and reporting.

Every day, thousands of industrial assets are inspected manually to ensure proper maintenance and safety. There is a huge potential in digitalization of such inspection processes when it comes to planning, execution, analysis and reporting. Today’s regime is characterized by manual labor and hazardous working conditions, printed inspection programs and reports, as well as a lack of integration with digital representations of the inspection targets. 

Our ambition is to create a fully automated and end-to-end digital inspection process – from planning to data collection and analysis to reporting. An autonomous drone system equipped with precise 3D and RGB imaging sensors will be developed to collect inspection data, replacing the need for manual, visual inspection in dull, dirty and dangerous (DDD) environments. The system will include software for planning and carrying out inspections, taking advantage of digital twins (i.e. structural models) when they are available, as well as cloud services for report generation and automatic detection of possible defects, such as cracks, corrosion or deformations. Eliminating the need for human operators to enter DDD environments will in turn improve personnel safety, inspection quality, reduce inspection cost, increase asset uptime and potentially have positive environmental impacts – since improved inspection practices can reduce risk of malfunction and accidents.",Næringsliv,Næringsliv,10560000,Øystein Skotheim,SCOUT DRONE INSPECTION AS,Trondheim

SPECTRUM aims at exploiting the graph structure of neural networks to improve their performance, by using Spectral Graph Theory (SGT). In particular, the goals of SPECTRUM are: (G1) to provide an original framework for optimizing existing neural network architectures by modifying the graphs underlying their structure; (G2) to design and optimize a novel architecture based on the theory of Markov chains on graphs and inspired by the mechanism of signal transmission in the human brain during the learning process. For both G1 and G2, SGT will provide tools to quantify the dependence of the neural network efficiency on the structure of the graph underlying it and, hence, methods to improve efficiency. The main challenges of SPECTRUM are: (CH1) solving open problems in SGT related to the optimization of quantities such as the algebraic connectivity and Kemeny’s constant over certain families of graphs and to the use of Matrix Theory and Algebraic Graph Theory to speed up the computation of those quantities for graphs associated with neural networks, by exploiting their hierarchical structure; (CH2) solving technical issues concerning the implementation of the novel neural network architecture of G2. The PM will carry out the project at EPFL for the first two years and at UiO for the final year. The training at EPFL and the collaboration with Prof. Marcus will be crucial to address CH2; Prof. Dahl will support the rest of the team mainly for the aspects related to CH1. In the final stage of the project, the PM will organize scientific activities at UiO to disseminate the findings of SPECTRUM and to transfer the knowledge acquired in Switzerland to the Norwegian research community.

313737,An underwater robotics concept for dynamically changing environments,2021,2024,"As salmon farm sites are moved further offshore and to more exposed locations, working conditions are increasingly challenging. Farmers therefore aim to automate certain operations to facilitate safer working conditions. Automation and autonomous unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) are furthermore key elements in meeting the desire for increased precision in finfish farming that will enable aquaculture to advance operational efficiency, safety and thus sustainability. 

While current models and control strategies for UUVs allow navigation among rigid structures in static environments, they are not sufficient for UUV operations in a dynamic fish farm environment where the UUV needs to react to the presence of animals and deformable structures influenced by external forces such as waves and currents. 

In the CHANGE project, fundamental knowledge on modelling of UUVs interacting with complex environments will be developed together with advanced control strategies. The developed models will include fish behaviour and deformation of flexible structures, combined with influences from the surrounding environment (e.g. currents, waves), thus providing data for feedback control loops. Integrating these with the novel control strategies, will enable real-time control of the UUV during autonomous navigation in aquaculture fish cages without colliding with fish or flexible structures despite variable currents or waves. The functionality of the resulting new control paradigm will be tested in laboratory experiments that mimic the dynamic environments of aquaculture sites. Final field tests at active salmon farms will be employed to validate the developed models and strategies during demanding operations. By enabling UUVs to adapt their actions to the dynamically changing environment, CHANGE will promote the sustainable expansion of Norwegian salmon farming while simultaneously offering opportunities also for application outside the aquaculture context.",Teknisk-industrielle institutter,Instituttsektor,7892000,Eleni Kelasidi,SINTEF OCEAN AS,Trondheim

There are devastating consequences for both patients and their families, as well as overwhelming healthcare expenditures. CVD costs the Norwegian economy more than 120 NOK billion per year. Long-term management of chronic CVD is an especially high fraction of these costs. 
Echocardiography (echo) is the primary imaging tool for cardiologists to assess cardiac function and structures. It is essential in evaluating and monitoring chronic and acute cardiac disease as it provides a low cost, mobile and real-time view into the heart. Echo can be used to visualize and quantify overall structure and function of the heart, cardiac muscle, valves, pathologies and blood flow.

Echo AI will utilize artificial intelligence to provide workflow improvements by seamlessly integrating image acquisition, analysis and reporting. It will maximize consistency, accuracy, and completeness in accordance with established clinical guidelines. 

This will be done by developing fully automatic measurements and interpretation of cardiac images originating from an ultrasound scanner. The automated analysis will, in combination with established clinical guidelines, lead to a set of clinical findings.

313768,Artificial Intelligence and Mathematical Modelling for Riser Integrity Structural Evaluation,2020,2024,"Drilling risers are slender structures used during offshore operations by drilling companies to provide access from a surface vessel to the top section of the well (wellhead) at the sea floor. The purpose is to allow for drilling or completion of wells or to perform workover of the wells at a later stage. The lowermost section of the riser is usually a blowout preventer (BOP) that is to contain hydrocarbons in the case of an unexpected release. However, BOPs are very heavy structures that cause significant structural fatigue of wellheads when exposed to loads from the riser. 

Different technologies have been used to reduce the loads applied to the wellheads. The study focuses on a few much used technologies including the Reactive Flex-Joint (RFJ) which has been in commercial use for approximately half a year. The RFJ is effectively a muscle placed on top of the BOP counteracting the loads applied by the riser. The technology has been carefully studied earlier, but new data allows for more in-depth understanding of its complex mechanical response. 

Global riser analysis models (numerical models) are much used to assess structural integrity of wellhead and risers. There are in the literature, however, few examples of such models being independently validated by measurements. Thus far it has not been common to place sensors on riser systems to measure loads directly due to relatively high cost of sensor systems. Furthermore, systematic evaluation of data from sensors is not widely reported.

Most models used for assessment of riser loads are based on finite element methods or other types of discretization of the fundamental partial differential equations. An alternative approach however are machine learning algorithms that rather make use of measured data from operations offshore. Such methods could in principle be more accurate and faster when used within certain limits.",Næringsliv,Næringsliv,1781000,Per Thomas Moe,FMC KONGSBERG SUBSEA AS,Kongsberg
313898,Autonomous Cargo-Handling and Transportation,2020,2023,"Handling and transportation of goods is a manual process with great operational risk. Goods-handling at ports and logistic hubs require large teams of workers and is dangerous and prone to human error. Accidents and work-related injuries are common, and in the period 2009-2014 in Norway, the following industries represent 67% of the total casualties; construction industry (59), transportation and logistics (44), agriculture and fishing (43) and industry in general (33).

For a typical onshore base operator, 50-60% of the total costs are related to labour. By remotely controlled & autonomous handling and transportation of goods, calculations show that it is possible to reduce labour costs with 40% to 60%, and almost completely remove accidents causing casualties and work-related injuries. Increased use of remote control & autonomy enables increased competitiveness despite high labour cost. Drones for priority-deliveries to e.g. offshore sites will increase efficiency and reduce CO2 emissions.

We aim to develop a technology platform consisting of software, sensors and compute-devices that will function as the “eyes, senses and brain” turning forklifts, drones and cranes into smart, collaborative devices. This will allow manually- and autonomously controlled transportation devices to interact in uncontrolled environments with self-awareness, smart AI perception of the surroundings, including machine-to-machine communication.

More specifically, the project aims to develop perception- and robotic control technology through computer vision and artificial intelligence, allowing autonomous control and interaction of cranes, forklifts and drones, thus enabling autonomous handling of goods.

The underlying idea is to combine well-established and robust physics-based full order models (FOM), that are made effective by reduced order modelling (ROM), and use of probabilistic data-driven models to both increase the accuracy as well as focus simulation efforts where the information gained produce the most value with respect to the relevant decision context.

Creating hi-fidelity insights for better real-time decision-support in complex and high-risk systems requires innovative and new ways of combining data-driven and physics-based modelling, beyond current approaches (e.g. hybrid modelling, multi-fidelity modelling, etc). Integrating these model domains in a way that ensures both that the computational speed and the overall uncertainty is acceptable is the biggest research challenge of the project. This will enable the asset owners to make faster and better safety-critical decisions and reduce (overly conservative) restrictions on operating windows, maintenance and inspection intervals, etc.

Increasing uptime, more optimal production, and avoiding safety critical incidents, if only by a few percent, has a huge value for the asset owners. 

“Conventional finite-elements simulations appear to be conservative compared with what we observe from sensor data. However, models based on sensor data do not capture safety-critical behaviour which we have not yet experienced. In effect, neither model is able to give proper decision support and we are left with conservatism to offset the uncertainty”.

313932,Large-scale personalized omics networks to model the disruption of gene regulation in cancer,2021,2025,"In the past decade, next generation sequencing technologies have been widely applied to study cancer. Large collaborative efforts have mapped various ‘omics landscapes, including gene expression, mutations, and methylation profiles, for a wide variety of cancer types. However, the impact of these approaches on patient outcomes has been limited. It has become clear that, in order to understand what drives cancer and to identify new biomarkers and therapeutic targets, we need to integrate multiple ‘omics data types to gain greater insight into the molecular interactions that occur in the development and progression of the disease.

In this project, we propose to develop advanced computational tools to model transcriptional and post-transcriptional gene regulatory interactions in large-scale gene regulatory networks by integrating transcription factor and miRNA binding with target gene co-expression information. We will use an innovative mathematical approach to model these networks for individual cancer patients. We will develop new computational tools using methodologies from network science and machine learning to integrate these large-scale patient-specific networks with mutation data and with clinical information.

We will apply our tools to large-scale pan-cancer datasets to map the pan-cancer atlas of gene regulation. For each cancer type, we will analyze individual patient networks in the context of heterogeneity, response to treatment, and survival. In parallel, we will perform a pan-cancer analysis to uncover similarities and differences in regulatory interactions across multiple cancer types. We will perform experimental validation to test the involvement of candidate regulatory interactions in cancer development. This work will advance the field of precision network medicine, improve our understanding of gene regulation in cancer, and identify the underlying biological mechanisms that drive cancer development, progression, and clinical phenotypes.",Universiteter,UoH-sektor,7984000,Marieke Kuijjer,Norsk senter for molekylærmedisin (NCMM),Oslo

While considerable advances have been made in recent years in the area of autonomous drilling, the administration/management of drilling and completion operations is still dominated by use of outdated legacy software and Excel spreadsheets. This applies to such areas as logistics coordination, POB planning, operations scheduling, reporting, operations follow-up and experience transfer. Current state of affairs within most E&P companies is that well construction planning and execution spans multiple, disconnected systems that comprise a mixture of obsolete legacy software and semi-manual documents and spreadsheets. Historically, spreadsheet templates with macros have been used to document time plans. These have been manually populated with time estimates influenced by the past experience and judgement of an individual drilling engineer. Monte Carlo simulations have been then utilized to derive the estimates for planned tasks and activities. The resultant spreadsheet forms the master copy of the activity plan and is used to circulate the plan to drilling engineers, rig operators, logistics providers and service companies.

The industry is discovering that the reliable and efficient passing of such plans between the multiple disconnected legacy systems is a practical impossibility, and that semi-automated integration has increased the probability of human error. Manually rechecking plan content throughout the process to prevent the loss or corruption of data during transfer has, to some extent, mitigated these problems but has required considerable resources and expertise.",Næringsliv,Næringsliv,7456000,Torbjørn E.

Verdens befolkning må endre adferd og raskt innføre virkemidler skal vi lykkes med å gjøre Norge til et lavutslippssamfunn i 2030. Norske kommuner har forpliktet seg til å kutte klimagassutslippene med minst 50 prosent gjennom å kutte direkte utslipp innen 2030. Innbyggernes personlige fotavtrykk - indirekte utslipp - er utelatt fra dette regnskapet, bl.a. fordi det ikke finnes pålitelige data og verktøy som kan brukes til å dokumentere de indirekte utslippene. En gjennomsnittshusholdning har indirekte klimagassutslipp som overgår direkteutslipp med omtrent 10-gangen.

I dag mangler et verktøy for å beregne og synliggjøre disse utslippene. Det ønsker vi å utvikle i prosjektet Zero emission citizens (ZEC), som skal bestå av en datahub som samler klimadata automatisk, beregner og visualiserer klimafotavtrykket til befolkningen i en tilgjengelig innbyggerportal. 

ZEC vil gi myndigheter, næringsliv og akademia pålitelige data samt et analyseverktøy som kan brukes til dokumentasjon, gi økt innsikt i bærekraftig forbruk og produksjon og skape innbyggerinvolvering  i tråd med FNs bærekraftsmål og våre klimaforpliktelser. 

Prosjektets sentrale utfordringen er innenfor strukturering og analyse av store mengder data. Foruten å kjøre avanserte beregninger for å tallfeste utslippet forbundet med alle slags banktransaksjoner, vil det måtte utvikles en logikk for å sette informasjonen sammen til en helhetlig fotavtrykket.

In this project, the application of the software is extended to adaptive control. Each process step in the aluminium value chain is associated with process variations as well as variations in chemical composition of the alloy. Without an overall, predictive and adaptive process control system, these variations can accumulate outside tolerance specifications, which may lead to huge added production costs in terms of scrapped components and parts.

Bridges are in focus, with the demand for sustainable, cost effective and durable solutions. The use of aluminium is deemed a viable solution towards sustainable infrastructure like bridges. Today, aluminium is used in only a marginal number of bridges in Norway and abroad due to the lack of rational design criteria, efficient production methods and reliable durability assessment methods. In contradiction, it becomes clear that aluminium-based bridges can offer large advantages for the Norwegian society for several reasons. Done in the right way, the use of aluminium reduces costs for construction and maintenance due to aluminium's low weight and corrosion resistance. Further, the new market of aluminium bridges will grow important parts of the Norwegian industry, creating jobs. Finally, use of aluminium can reduce the carbon footprint as compared to bridges made of traditional materials, concrete or steel. The limited number of aluminium bridges is said to be due to traditional bridge design methods being linked to use steel and concrete as materials, not evaluating correctly the effect of alternative materials as aluminium. The lack of knowledge to produce and install aluminium bridges cost effective is also indicated as a reason. The latter is related to production methods and knowledge gaps of the response in aluminium components under relevant load scenarios, which gives overly conservative design codes. The underlying idea of the AluBridge project is to develop a robust, cost efficient and sustainable aluminium bridges.

To achieve this, we need precision food production, a food industry that produces exactly the products and qualities that the market needs and at the same time minimizes food waste. This research program will contribute to such an industry by the development of three enabling technologies: 
1. Novel biotechnological processes which may provide targeted production of crucial food components, by exploiting rest raw materials from food processing. We will develop and study new processes based on combinations of enzymatic protein hydrolysis, precision fermentation and culturing of meat.
2. Smart sensors for rapid assessment of food quality, which will enable monitoring and control of production processes to minimise food loss and optimise yield and end quality. We will develop spectroscopic sensors for in-line quality control and chemical characterisation, and study how these can be part of larger solutions that facilitate product differentiation, consumer satisfaction and personalized nutrition.
3. Data analytical tools that transform large and complex data into relevant, reliable and useful information. Such tools are strictly needed to release the full potential of the technologies 1 and 2, as well as of other scientific disciplines and modern food industry. We will address challenges related to prediction and interpretation by combining methods from statistics, chemometrics and machine learning.

In seismic data processing, artificial neural networks (ANNs) have the potential to be applied to many of the key processing steps (deblending, seismic interference attenuation, deghosting, etc.) which today involve significant testing time and computational power. Once trained, ANNs are computationally very light and potentially adaptable to different datasets. Sorting the data from common source domain to another by using mathematical transformation such as Wavelet transform or Shearlet transform may make the target signals and noise have more differences in characteristics. Their use could, therefore, save processing time and, in the long term, impact the whole business sector.

314321,MOF Based Single-Site Cooperative Catalysis for CO2 Hydrogenation,2021,2024,"One of the main challenges of the 21st century is the reduction of CO2 emissions into the atmosphere by replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy sources. The CO2pCat research project aims at developing a multivariate metal organic framework (MTV-MOF) involving functionalized linker cooperation for the selective hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol. Methanol is a versatile liquid and an ideal CO2 derivative when made by renewable hydrogen sources. However, efforts to perform this reaction with heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysts under mild conditions have failed at achieving high conversion with high selectivity. A combined approach, immobilizing well-defined molecular catalysts on porous materials has only yielded reduction of CO2 to formate. The use of MOFs with Cu(I) functionalized Zr-nodes leads to ethanol and requires a photosynthesizer to stabilize the catalyst. In CO2pCat, these limitations will be overcome by using linkers able to: 1) hold, and stabilize the active catalyst; 2) promote the cooperative activation of H2 via metal-ligand bifunctionality; and 3) promote the cooperative hydrogenation of formic acid via catalyst-amine cooperation. In order to achieve these goals, state-of-the-art computational methods and machine learning techniques will be used to design these linkers. The systems designed in silico will be implemented experimentally by using the recent advances in MOF synthesis by postsynthetic strategies. Computational methods combined with kinetic experiments will be used to get mechanistic insight into the cooperative activation of H2 and formic acid on reported and newly developed systems. In total, CO2pCat will provide chemical understanding on CO2 hydrogenation processes, a large database of catalyst-linkers able to hydrogenate CO2, and a single-site heterogeneous catalyst for the hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol.",Universiteter,UoH-sektor,11911000,Ainara Nova,Senter for materialvitenskap og nanoteknologi,Oslo
314486,Digital Prism and the Nordic Model of Workplace Democracy under Pressure,2021,2024,"Big data and artificial intelligence are radically transforming the ways in which we work, are hired and fired, managed and led. Datafication is impacting our ability to influence our work conditions. Yet, the consequences of datafication of work for workplace democracy, co-determination, individual autonomy and participation have so far not been fully understood. Workplace monitoring, algorithmic management systems, automated decision-making support systems, performance quantification and similar technologies represent a new form of workplace governance. Algorithmic governance, as a new mode of power, puts the Norwegian model of workplace democracy and the tripartite collaboration between employees and trade unions, employers, and authorities, under pressure. This project investigates the effects of digital transformation of work on the Norwegian model of workplace democracy. DigiWORK brings together an interdisciplinary team of researchers from Norway, Denmark and England, from across critical sociology, social anthropology, management, criminology, law, and history to investigate this fundamental transformation through a combination of qualitative case studies and quantitative surveys of co-determination, workplace democracy, participation and autonomy in the Norwegian 1) law enforcement, 2) healthcare, 3) higher education, and 4) petroleum industry. We will deliver an in-depth and robust theory of the transformation of power and governance in and across these sectors as a result of datafication. Our novel comparative analysis, complemented by historical and legal perspectives, will also provide actionable insights and policy relevant recommendations for stakeholders, e.g. trade unions and policymaker. The project will result in 12 peer-reviewed articles, 2 special issues, 1 edited volume, 3 conferences and 3 workshops, 1 set of policy recommendations, and broad popular dissemination.",Universiteter,UoH-sektor,11935000,Eivind Falkum,Arbeidsforskningsinstituttet AFI,NA
314499,Fossil temporal dynamics of phenotypic selection & life history evolution,2021,2024,"Natural selection is one of the pillars of evolution. It has shaped the diversity of organismal forms we see both today, among living organisms, and in the fossil record. However, although the fossil record offers a direct window into selection in the deep past, many aspects of selection have only been studied in extant populations. The main barrier remains to obtain estimates of fitness components and selection gradients from fossil populations to directly link evolutionary parameters and selective forces on macroevolutionary time scales. 

Which combination of phenotypic traits will produce the most offspring? Can we infer these using populations, long dead? Using a novel approach based on abundant fossil populations of a unique model system, a species-rich genus of encrusting cheilostome bryozoans, I will overcome the barrier of studying selection in the deep past. Using the model bryozoan genus, I will robustly estimate fecundity (a fitness component) from fossilized morphological traits and investigate the past selection gradients and the potential driving forces of phenotypic selection on a high resolution time series that spans the last 2.5 million years. 

Addressing key questions such as —Are selection gradients for the same traits for different, closely allied species similar or different during the same time periods, in the same habitats? How different are the strengths and mode of selection and what do these patterns say about evolutionary constraints and historical contingency? Do ecological interactions affect the evolution of phenotypic traits such that there are long-term, macroevolutionary consequences? What are the relationships between speciation/extinction rates and rates of phenotypic evolution?— this project will open research avenues that are to date impenetrable.",Universiteter,UoH-sektor,7523000,Emanuela Di Martino,Naturhistorisk museum,Oslo

314544,Co-tester: Collective-Adaptive Testing of Coevolving Autonomous Cyber-Physical Systems of Systems under Uncertainty,2021,2025,"Nowadays, approaches for developing, operating, and evolving Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) to realize and optimize complex processes have started to change radically, mainly due to the use of advanced technologies, e.g., the Internet of Things and Artificial Intelligence (AI). CPSs developed with such technologies have novel characteristics, e.g., 1) enabling the integration of previously technologically isolated CPSs into a significantly larger, highly cooperative and intelligent system, i.e., Cyber-Physical Systems of Systems (CPSoS); 2) constantly evolving individually and cooperatively to respond to ever-changing physical and technological environment, under which the CPSoS and its constituted CPSs are operated; 3) frequent interactions within the CPSoS (among its CPSs) and with its environment foster new emergent behaviors and services that cannot be supported by individual CPS or a small number of CPSs. These characteristics threaten the dependability of CPSoS, which consequently threatens their capability to provide trustworthy services. 
Though there exist testing methodologies for ensuring the dependability of individual CPSs, testing CPSoS as a whole with the consideration of the constantly evolving nature of individual CPSs and the CPSoS itself under ever-changing environment, and various levels of internal and external uncertainties inherent in the CPSoS and its operating environment, is a very new and challenging research area. The Co-tester project aims to addresses this challenge by developing novel collective-adaptive testing strategies, which will be empowered with advanced AI technologies (e.g., machine learning and evolutionary computation techniques), supported with novel strategies for discovering uncertain and unknown behaviors of CPSoS, its constituted CPSs, and operating environment, which will holistically and intelligently manipulate and manage evolutions of CPSoS, the CPSs, and their operating environment for extensive testing of CPSoS.",Øvrige forskningsinstitutter,Instituttsektor,12000000,Tao Yue,SIMULA RESEARCH LABORATORY AS,Bærum

314690,Interview training of child-welfare and law-enforcement professionals interviewing maltreated children supported via artificial avatars.,2021,2024,"Maltreatment and abuse of children is a significant societal problem and with serious damaging effects on children’s behavior, psychological development and adjustment. Both Child Protective Services (CPS) and law enforcement play important roles in protecting and assisting mistreated children. In their roles as investigators, they must elicit from children detailed, coherent and reliable accounts of their experiences. Researchers and professionals have developed best-practice guidelines for interviewing children to maximize narrative details. But despite huge investments in training programs, practitioners routinely fail to follow best-practices guidelines (Lamb, 2016). Recent studies show that interactive, computer-based learning activities can improve an investigator’s interviewer performance (Powell et al., 2016). This project seeks to create an empirically based interview-training system using realistic avatars and to determine if such a system can effectively train CPS and law enforcement professionals to conduct interviews of consistently high quality. To achieve this goal, an interdisciplinary team of psychologists and AI experts with expertise studying and working with at-risk children will use extant AI technologies and data from past investigative interviews with maltreated children to create a real-looking child avatar capable of expressing emotion and apparently spontaneous responses. This avatar will become part of an interview-training system that will be implemented with the cooperation of the CPS and police, and studied by the project team. The training system will then be evaluated, using pre-training and post-training and long-term post-training assessments, to determine effectiveness.",Universiteter,UoH-sektor,12000000,Gunn Astrid Baugerud,FAKULTET FOR SAMFUNNSVITENSKAP,Oslo
314778,High-throughput alloy design of superior thermoelectric materials (Allotherm),2021,2024,"One of the most pressing challenges of our society is to provide sustainable and secure access to energy resources for everyone. The largest unexploited source of energy is heat; more than 60% of the global consumption is lost as heat, and huge primary sources like solar and geothermal heat are not exploited. Thermoelectric (TE) generators have the potential to convert heat into electricity without harmful working fluids or moving parts. However, the current generation of TE generators are based on rare, expensive and toxic materials, and their efficiency is not high enough to be economically viable in many situations. The Allotherm project seeks to resolve this by identifying new, superior TE materials with increased efficiency, based on safe, available and sustainable materials. This will be done by performing a high-throughput screening starting with most known and many hypothetical inorganic materials. Pivotal in this development is alloy design, which in this context means substitution with isoelectronic elements (from the same group of elements). Thermoelectric properties will be predicted with first-principles calculations coupled with Boltzmann's transport equations. The screening will be step-wise, adding successively more advanced features to the selection criteria. Machine learning will be used to speed up the most computationally challenging part of the screening procedure, where the miscibility is predicted for all promising alloys. Novel use of online database resources and feedback loops will make this particularly efficient and precise. The final selection of materials systems will be based on accurate assessments of all relevant TE properties without any adjustable parameters. In addition, important features like maximum doping level and optimal dopant species will be predicted theoretically. The predictions will be tested experimentally with a range of techniques encompassing synthesis, processing, characterization and measurements.",Teknisk-industrielle institutter,Instituttsektor,11999000,Ole Martin Løvvik,BÆREKRAFTIG ENERGITEKNOLOGI,Trondheim
315008,"The Corona-crisis, structural change, and macroeconomic policy",2021,2024,"This project combines unique data sources, alternative methodological approaches and new economic theories to analyse economic crisis and structural change. Our working hypothesis is that crisis events may have very different effects on the distribution of household income and firms earnings when the economy is undergoing structural changes, and this knowledge is important for policymakers. 

Against this background, this research project is organised in three work packages:

First, we will explore the possibilities offered by various Big Data sources and alternative methodological approaches invented within the fields of, e.g., National Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML), to address whether better predictions of rapid business cycle changes can be made, so as to provide a reliable early warning system. Understanding the sources behind economic fluctuations has been a core field in macroeconomics. In that respect, the Corona-virus pandemic is an unprecedented event, generating some of the largest business cycle swings ever recorded. Managing to predict and prepare for such events in the future would be welfare improving. 

Second, we will develop and evaluate macroeconomic theory which studies how the steady state of the economy changes as a result of large shocks and permanent changes, e.g., the corona crisis and persistent petroleum market changes, and how the transition to this new steady state comes by. Macroeconomic policy analysis will have an important role in these theories, as it can potentially facilitate (a preferable) structural change in the economy as well influence the optimal path towards this new steady state.

Finally, we will develop and use new empirical models tailored for the analysis of large cross-sectional time series to facilitate empirical analysis of the short- and long-run heterogeneous effects households and firms might experience following major macroeconomic shocks and policy changes.",Vitenskapelige høyskoler,UoH-sektor,12000000,Hilde Christiane Bjørnland,STIFTELSEN HANDELSHØYSKOLEN BI,Oslo
315029,Next Generation Explainable Medical Computer Vision,2021,2025,"A large fraction of the data gathered in health care consists of images and as the field transitions towards data-driven health, the opportunity for clinical decision support systems and thus the need for processing medical images becomes apparent. Deep learning artificial intelligence technologies have emerged as the state-of-the-art for image processing as they achieve unprecedented predictive performance due to their ability to learn complex representations from the input data. However, in safety-critical domains, such as the medical domain, there are key-obstacles that need to be resolved before wide spread adaption in the clinic. Obstacles for Universal Healthcare are the inability of deep learning approaches to provide interpretable solutions, the lack of theoretical understanding of deep learning models, and the lack of annotated patients in the health domain. MedEx will develop interpretable data-efficient methods that are able to use unannotated data and are applicable across hospitals and not limited to a particular imaging protocol. The primary application focus is the detection of lung-cancer from PET/MR/CT images in order to improve early-detection and thereby improve patient survivability and quality of care. The secondary application is diabetic retinopathy detection from fungus images to enable efficient systematic screening. While methodological advances are generic and will impact data-driven health and science beyond, concrete results and outcomes will find application through MedEx's clinical stakeholders.

315041,SmaRTWork - a digital system for personalised return to work recommendations for sick-listed with musculoskeletal disorders,2021,2027,"Musculoskeletal disorders are the most common reason for sickness absence. Despite extensive research on return to work interventions the results are inconsistent and there is a lack of evidence in regards to who needs what measures. Furthermore, it is not only a question about who needs what; it is also a question about when. The aim of this project is to develop and evaluate an intelligent decision support system that i) enables early identification of individuals at risk of long-term sick leave due to musculoskeletal disorders, and ii) provides personalised recommendations to facilitate sustainable return to work. The SmaRTWork tool will utilize state-of-the-art artificial intelligence (AI) methodologies for the early risk prediction and subsequent tailoring of a personalised intervention to facilitate sustainable return to work. The core foundation for the decision support system will be case-based reasoning (CBR). The main principle of CBR is to reuse knowledge from previous successful cases to suggest solutions for new and similar cases. Workers who have been sick listed for 8 weeks due to musculoskeletal disorders will be invited to use The SmaRTWork tool. After consent they will receive credentials to access the web-based SmaRTWork tool which can be accessed by a computer/tablet/phone. The effect of the SmaRTWork tool will be evaluated in a randomized controlled trial. The main outcome will be time to sustainable return to work (i.e. one month back at work without relapse) based on registry data. There will be a process evaluation that will assess facilitators and barriers for implementation, and qualitative studies to explore how the sick-listed workers and other relevant stakeholders experience using the system.",Universiteter,UoH-sektor,12000000,Lene Aasdahl,Institutt for samfunnsmedisin og sykepleie,Trondheim

We aim at vastly expanding the applicability of today’s glacier surface mass balance regression techniques using deep learning for image classification and regression. First we will harvest unprecedented amounts of freely available remote sensing data to build data cubes of a variety of glacierized regions in the world. These databases will contain information on relevant mass balance predictors including snow cover area, glacier facies, albedo and glacier elevation changes. In this big data approach we will use state-of-the-art database software necessary to efficiently handle the ever increasing amount of remote sensing data. To achieve the highest possible quality for the predictors we will design novel glacier facies and snow cover classification algorithms based on deep learning. Our method using convolutional networks will be superior compared to today’s commonly used classification based on band ratio and indices as they can be trained with multi-resolution and multi-sensor data (including optical and synthetic aperture radar data) in a single classification framework. Output of the classification will be an updated multi-temporal glacier inventory. Once the regional data cubes are build we will use advanced regression techniques e.g. deep regression to extract a consistent and decade-long time series of surface mass balance for a variety of different glacier types. We will first design the methodology for glaciers in Norway, Svalbard and European Alps and other regions with different glacier characteristics and with solid training and validation data for the period 2000-2020. We will then test the transferability to glacierized regions with less base data available.

Ontologies are useful to express the relevant knowledge about a domain of interest. This proposal is based on learning models from computational learning theory.

Today, the design of learning systems primarily occurs before runtime, requiring continuous updates to tackle changes. In the future hyper-connected digital world, learning systems will need to work radically different than today, ubiquitously connected to a tremendous amount of diverse data and facing unanticipated and a priori unknown conditions during operation. The essence of ULEARN is to replace the actual manual system design with a dynamic software architecture that implements well-composed learning processes, which are dynamically optimized and evolving in a holistic lifetime manner. Computing systems will self-learn, adapting and evolving to the highly dynamic conditions at runtime. Such new designed systems can learn from high-dimensional complex data and are capable to autonomously evolve their own learning processes under changing and unforeseen conditions, lifelong. This new paradigm will be achieved by the concerted research of three PIs, bringing together diverse expertise in unsupervised learning, natural computing, evolutionary architecture and software engineering. The research is centered around finding structure in data, recognizing anomalies during operation, adapting the learning architecture and (re-)organizing and evolving own learning processes at runtime against unforeseen situations. Furthermore, the whole approach will be conceptualized into a novel self-learning system to realize the integrated vision of unsupervised lifelong learning.

In SiD, we will develop a high-throughput microfluidics-based in vitro transcription method, coupled to in vivo screening efforts with DNA and RNA sequencing. The experimental efforts will allow us to determine the cis-acting DNA sequences for 21 sigma-factors, belonging to three bacterial species, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas putida and Bacillus subtilis, at the single-nucleotide resolution. With the large-scale data, we will perform in silico data analysis, using statistics and machine learning, to develop algorithms that can infer sigma-factor-specific cis-binding motifs within bacterial promoters. The proposed methodology can be applied to any host of interest, and thus opens up the possibility to expand our knowledge on transcriptional regulation to a wide range of microorganisms.

316277,An AI platform to facilitate the rapid development of T cell based diagnostic tests: applied to SARS-CoV-2,2020,2022,"It has been over a century since we encountered a pandemic like COVID-19. The rate of global transmission and the associated morbidity and mortality have been both shocking and devastating. The pandemic has sparked fears of a chronic worldwide recession or depression. Shut-downs, social distancing and travel restrictions have destroyed many jobs and businesses. A reliable diagnostic test to quantify whether citizens have been infected or have recovered from the virus is critical to overcome this crisis. 

A proposal that is gaining increasing traction is the use of diagnostic tests to generate immunity passports—i.e., certification that a citizen is immune to SARS-CoV-2. Citizens in possession of an immunity passport could then return to work and travel, thereby reigniting the economy. However, as governments gear up efforts to establish immunity passports based on antibody tests, there is a significant risk that these passports will be denied to immune individuals. Recent studies suggest that only 50% of convalescent COVID-19 patients have a detectable antibody response as their infection has been controlled and eradicated by the cellular arm of their immune system driven by T cells. It is therefore critical to develop diagnostic tests that can quantify cellular immunity towards SARS-CoV-2.

In this project NEC OncoImmunity (NOI) will work with our partner Professor Ludvig Munthe at the Oslo University Hospital (OUS) to develop a T-cell diagnostic to complement the antibody tests. NOI will use artificial intelligence (AI) and bioinformatics methods to select the viral peptides that can be used to identify T-cells that provide immunity against COVID-19, which will be subsequently validated using COVID-19 biobanks and T-cell assays developed by Professor Ludvig Munthe’s group.

Thus, the mixed layer transfer function must be represented accurately in climate models, especially in the North Atlantic and in the Arctic oceans which are, respectively, hotspots of anthropogenic CO2 storage and warming. Large discrepancies in mixed layer depths are found in low resolution CMIP5 models, in part because these models do not parameterize properly the spatial heterogeneities induced by the presence of a discontinuous and very dynamic sea ice cover, mesoscale eddies and submesoscale fronts and filaments at the kilometer-scale.

The region of interest ranging from the North Atlantic to the Arctic ocean is especially relevant to future changes of the European climate. MEDLEY brings together state of the art observational datasets, groundbreaking submesoscale-resolving basin scale models, an innovative sea-ice model, and the latest generation of climate models with an eddying ocean component participating in the HighResMIP intercomparison. By pooling their expertise, MEDLEY members will produce the most complete evaluation of the mixed layer dynamics in state of the art climate models, from the North Atlantic to the Arctic ocean. MEDLEY will improve our understanding of the relationship between air- sea fluxes and mixed layer properties, taking into account the mediation of the fluxes induced by the fractured sea ice cover. MEDLEY will evaluate the effect of spatial heterogeneities on mixed layer properties, including currents and kinetic energy, as well as the relationship between the mixed layer and the interior through the stratified transition layer. Building on interdisciplinary collaborations of its members, MEDLEY will take advantage of the most recent data analysis methods (e.g., machine learning-based classification).",Miljøinstitutter,Instituttsektor,4451000,Einar Örn Olason,STIFTELSEN NANSEN SENTER FOR MILJØ OG FJERNMÅLING,Bergen

Nå er tiden inne for å jobbe med sosiale nettverkstiltak, hvor pasienten og hans/hennes sosiale og profesjonelle nettverk koordineres gjennom et forpliktende samarbeid, og hvor endringer i nettverket er en forutsetning for atferdsendring og støtte blant pasienter.",Næringsliv,Næringsliv,100000,Terje Spilde,DUGNAD.AI AS,Oslo
317105,SMARTINGALE : Smart and Agile Healthcare Provision by Facilitating Integration with AI and New Digital Technologies,2020,2020,"Currently, there are several challenges connected to the ageing population and the increase in the prevalence of chronic conditions. In combination with budget constraints, the health and care systems face rising costs and sustainability challenges. The proposed Smartingale solution supports health and care systems in adequately adapting their resources in a response to future health needs.
Based on current trends and developments, health and care should and can increasingly be provided location independent. In this way, it is possible for Smart Hospitals to offer decentralized and holistic, patient-centric care.  New digital technologies play an important role in transforming health and care systems. In particular, artificial intelligence and robotics have the potential to transform health and care facilities across their range of functions. However, integrating these technologies is often difficult and can be very time-consuming. 
The Smartingale solution aims to accelerate this process and facilitate different health and care facilities in implementing digital technologies by providing a framework and architecture they can use to ‘plug-and-play’ the technologies and easily embed them in their current care processes.

317107,Ventura,2020,2020,"Currently, European health care systems face many challenges. In addition to financial and transformational problems caused by increasing patient number and rising of their expectations, the major problem is connected with the health workforce:
• The High-Level Commission on Health Employment and Economic  projected a global shortage of 18 million health workers by 2030. For Europe, the gap in the supply of and demand for health workers in 2030 will be at least 1.4 million employees, including 300k physicians, 700k nurses and 400k other health workers [ ].
• Health workers are exposed to a complex variety of health and safety hazards every day, including sharp injuries, harmful chemicals and hazardous drugs, back injuries due to heavy lifting and, first of all, highly infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, hepatitis B and C, HIV/AIDS as well as emerging infectious diseases like SARS, H5/N1 influenza, COVID-19. Some statistics on occupational infectious diseases in health workers is needed.
• 78 % of physicians and 38 % of nurses experience burnout and reduction of work efficacy due to the health care staff shortage, overworking, long shifts, excessive and prolonged stress [ ]. All these results in poor and wrong decisions, depersonalization, lack of empathy and, therefore, increase chances for patients to stay in the hospital longer and/or return with complications.
The pressure rises exponentially in case of natural or technogenic disasters and, especially, epidemics. On-going COVID-19 pandemic demonstrates global unpreparedness of national health care systems and particular vulnerability of health workers.

We will develop a higher-resolution, UAV-based geoscanning system combined with machine-learning-based data processing workflows. Project owners and contractors will receive seamless 3D models with statistical precision over the full project area based on our data and a small number of strategically placed boreholes.
Globally, 90 % of infrastructure projects encounter cost overruns of 20-50 %. This is costing society unacceptable amounts of time and money. A lack of thorough geological understanding is frequently identified as a key contributor to these overruns. Our technology will significantly improve knowledge and thus decrease this risk. Public funds can be saved, and decisions can be made with a better understanding of the involved risks, improving the sustainability of infrastructure development.
Traditionally, costly direct ground investigations are used to investigate ground conditions. We have demonstrated that our method's return of investment is high when used to reduce traditional investigations. With our proposed development the price point will further decrease, due to the increased efficiency our margin will increase.

Den overordnede ideen til prosjektet er å utnytte muligheter innenfor maskinlæring og intelligent automasjon for å effektivisere prosessering av store datamengder tilgjengelig i “shadow payroll”-plattformen utviklet av det Britiske selskapet Certino. 

Gjennom prosjektsamarbeidet skal Akeo bidra til utviklingen av en optimalisert og intelligent ""shadow payroll""-plattform for å predikere skattekostnader og kalkuleringer før et internasjonalt oppdrag eller prosjekt starter. Dette skal oppnås ved å bruke eksisterende datasett og ta i bruk logistisk regresjon og sanntidsdata-teknikker (f.eks Gradient Descent).  

Første del av prosjektet vil bestå av å teste, utvikle og implementere et maskinlæringssystem som predikerer skatt for selskaper med globale og mobile arbeidsstyrker. Videre skal tjenesten testes i reelle omgivelser med to internasjonale bedrifter før systemet integreres med den eksisterende skyløsningen og siden lanseres i markedet.

It will collect large amounts of data from an array of field-deployed, wireless, low cost and self-powered IoT Devices, hosting many sensor types. The data will feed a cloud based system and use machine learning for fast processing and decision making. We will deliver a prototype of such a system to demonstrate its potential in the case of avalanche detection. We want to do this because mass movements, like landslides or avalanches, pose dramatic risks to individuals, populated areas, and critical transportation infrastructure.

FET Proactive call focuses on emerging themes and to establish a critical mass of European researchers in a number of promising exploratory research topics. The solution is to create machine learning models which can help farmers optimize the fertilizer, crop protection and seed quantities they apply within each field at the optimal time. This project will enable this through providing the technology necessary to classify the different zones of each field to optimize the inputs applied in each area, not only in terms of quantity but also timing. This would not only help the farmers reduce their input cost significantly but it would also optimize yield potential and reduce their Co2 footprint. One key component of our model and product is the ability to monitor the crops during the growth season including the ability to analyse fertilization-uptake, yield potential and performance, where Sentinel 1 and 2 and other EO imagery is a critical component. The current technological restrictions with existing EO data consisting of the different systems constitute a disjoint assortment of sources that cannot be readily combined and effectively jointly exploited. A notable example of the current limitations is illustrated by the domain of precision agriculture. The vast majority of agricultural fields are too small to be analysed from a public satellite such as Sentinel-2, while the high-resolution commercial images are much too expensive to make a commercially viable business case.",Næringsliv,Næringsliv,350000,Nils Helset,DIGIFARM AS,Hamar

Bygningene vil i fremtiden ha en mer aktiv rolle i energisystemet. Fra å bare være en energibruker, vil byggene også være energiprodusenter og de vil kunne gi mer fleksibilitet i kraftnettet. Et ""smart prediktivt"" bygg vil predikere byggets tekniske tilstand og justere styringen og reguleringen basert på en stor mengde data. Et ""smart kognitivt"" bygg vil i tillegg utnytte store mengder historiske data til å forbedre sine prediksjonsmodeller og systemer (selvlæring), uten at dette går på bekostning av brukeropplevelsen. 
IWMAC leverer i dag tjenesten «Smarte funksjoner» som er en egenutviklet regelbasert software. IWMAC ønsker å videreutvikle tilbudet og å være den første til å levere tjenestene som skal til for å kunne bygge «smarte prediktive» og «smarte kognitive» -bygg.
I dette prosjektet sikter vi mot å bruke modell-prediktiv kontroll (MPC, fra engelsk model-predictive control). MPC er en teknikk der en matematisk modell av en bygning blir brukt for å muliggjøre planlegging av driften av bygningen som en funksjon av, for eksempel, forutsagt predikert vær og beboers tilstedeværelse. Derimot reagerer konvensjonelle bygningskontrollsystemer på endringer i vær- og tilstedeværelsessituasjoner når de forekommer, uten noen forkunnskap. Den proaktive ""fremtidsrettet"" tilnærming til MPC gjør det mulig å optimalisere driften av VVS og andre systemer, noe som resulterer i betydelige forbedringer i energieffektivitet, komfortforhold, effektstyring og interaksjon mellom bygninger og nett, blant andre applikasjoner.

317454,MP: A Smart Mobile App to Facilitate Rehabilitation of Stroke Patients,2020,2021,"A 2020 report shows that “There are over 13.7 million new strokes worldwide each year."" 
Many stroke patients perform individually tailored exercises based on their own needs and symptoms. Activity monitors can help the patients to self-monitor and quantify their activity. The step counters mobile apps for healthy people are not applicable for stroke patients because of high variation in their movement patterns during walking, especially at a slow velocity. Furthermore, the variability of techniques and approaches individual stroke patients employ during rehabilitation is high. Thus, it is critical that the rehabilitation apps to be used by the stroke patients can address the high variability of movement patterns and velocities.
We have developed a mobile app to analyse data collected from sensors placed on the lower limb to classify and quantify activities (e.g., counting steps or exercises) and to identify if movements were performed correctly. The key difference of our mobile app from the commercial step counters in the market is that our mobile app uses machine learning algorithms to learn and classify movement patterns of each individual stroke patient and can, therefore, address the variation in movement patterns in stroke patients. The core machine learning algorithms have been developed and have been tested by healthy people to learn, classify, and summarize different kinds of movements. In this project, we will pilot the mobile app with stroke patients to evaluate the accuracy of the mobile app to classify activities and exercises of stroke patients. We will also interview the stroke patients and therapists to assess the potential clinical benefit of the system and collect user experience. Based on the evaluation results, we will update the mobile app to make it more suitable to be used by the end-users, i.e., stroke patients and therapists, and publish the evaluation results of the mobile app.",Universiteter,UoH-sektor,493000,Jingyue Li,NORGES TEKNISK-NATURVITENSKAPELIGE UNIVERSITET NTNU,Trondheim
317474,KVAL: Software for real-time production planning and bidding for renewable energy producers,2020,2021,"In this milestone project we will verify software that uses machine learning for real-time production planning and energy market bidding for renewable energy producers. 

To achieve the global environmental targets necessary for a sustainable future, today’s energy systems are transitioning rapidly. This require less fossil fuel based energy production and more renewable production, like solar and wind. Unfortunately, these sources lack the flexibility of fossil fuels, meaning that producers do not control when they produce. This causes a mismatch between supply and demand, which raises two fundamental questions. First, how do we deal with the surplus of renewable energy at times when there is too much supply? Second, how do we supply demand at times when there is too little production? Actors that can either store energy (e.g. in the form of batteries or pumped-hydro storage plants) or produce flexibly (i.e. hydropower producers), therefore have an increasingly important role in balancing the grid on short notice. Market mechanisms incentivise this behaviour, meaning that power producers can increase their profit margins while simultaneously benefiting the overall system by planning their production and bids smarter and more responsively. In the milestone project, we will verify software for real-time production planning and bidding for renewable energy producers, to enable them to achieve this goal.",Næringsliv,Næringsliv,500000,Kristin Jørstad,NTNU TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER AS,Trondheim

Hyperspectral imaging sensors are the state-of-the-art of Remote Sensing. Based on this technology, TracSense is developing a sensor system solution that gives detailed information regarding the icing status of the aircraft. To be able to achieve optimal results, investigations regarding the assembly of the system, hardware and software solutions are needed. Also, the system should be extensively tested in a large set of environmental variables in order to be improved and its robustness validated.

The deicing of aircraft bears significant financial and environmental costs to airlines, deicing companies and airport management. TracSense’s technology can significantly reduce the expenses of de-icing by providing the flight- and ground-crew with highly detailed information on the status of the aircraft - directly at the gate. Better information allows the crew to make more accurate decisions on the need for deicing. The more efficient operation of deicing facilities helps to prevent delays, since shorter deicing time may be used to achieve the same results. It also reduces the environmental and financial costs, since less energy, chemicals, man-hours and equipment-hours will be needed. Also, flight availability may be increased since the take off queues will be shorter and sometimes not even needed.

317606,Application of predictive data analytics to wellbore geomechanics on the Norwegian continental shelf,2020,2024,"Despite significant progress, borehole instabilities and well control incidents are still major challenges in drilling wells across the globe. On the Norwegian continental shelf about 40% of the wells encountered issues related to borehole stability or overpressure, leading to costly delays and the need for contingency measures affecting safety. Most of these problems can be avoided with a better understanding of the conditions in the subsurface and adjusted drilling practices, leading to more efficient and safer drilling.

By introducing drilling mechanics data, geomechanical modelling, and advanced data analytics, more reliable predictions of stress and pore-pressure can be obtained. Applying data analytics and machine learning solves problems with data irregularity and allows joint analysis of a higher number of wells, allowing the datasets to “learn from each other”. Combining geophysical logs and drilling mechanics data allows for a more precise determination of the top and base limits of overpressured zones in the subsurface. Furthermore, a quantified analysis of drilling mechanics data allows pressure prediction in non-shale lithologies, which has been a major challenge in the industry. 

In the project, the geomechanical methodology developed by Geoprovider will be scientifically verified and improved, resulting in higher cost efficiency and improved safety for drilling operations. Using the wealth of data available on the Norwegian continental shelf, a number of case studies will be presented demonstrating the progress and applicability of the methods.

CageEye is developing advanced monitoring and feeding control systems, using echo-acoustic sensor equipment and machine learning to translate fish behavior into knowledge. Or as we like to say: we “speak Fish”. Speaking fish means we can better match the feeding to the fish’s natural behavior and appetite than ever before.We monitor fish behaviour by utilisation of echo acoustics, Echo acoustics were used as a research tool since the 90s in the Aquaculture industry . CageEye formed in 2010 to commercially utilise this academic research and have since developed many iterations of hardware and software.  The company has gone through fast growth  ( 4 to 26 FTEs in 14months) to support its ever growing customer base and is now challenged with the design and manufacture of solutions that are globally scalable and commercially relisable across many species.  Our goal is also to ensure that the technologies we are using not only help with the future challenges of providing highly protein rich food sources for the increasing population but also in a manner that improves the health and welfare of the fish and with minimal impact on the environment through energy efficient technology.

We use advancements in modern technology to understand and predict the optimum farming methods for Aquaculture , this includes precision sensing in the cage , to edge processing to Cloud then application of AI to improve the health, wellbeing and efficiency .

317768,AI Augmented Analysis in digital biostratigraphy - palynology,2021,2023,"Biostratigraphy, using fossils to date rocks, is obligatory for all exploration wells drilled in the offshore Norwegian Sector. It is used to help understand the sub-surface geology and to correlate sections in wells both within fields and on a larger regional scale. Although biostratigraphic data was part of the digital revolution in the industry of the 1980’s, the actual study of the microfossils with a microscope and prepared glass slides has changed very little in the past decades.
By using image digitalisation and Artificial Intelligence a technique can be developed to scan microscope slides into a digital high-resolution image and an AI software specifically developed for this usage will find, identify and quantify the fossil content. With this new analysis method, we believe that we can not only decrease the time used for analyses but also obtaining data at a more statistically accurate level and mitigate human inconsistencies and biases.

With 3-dimentional microfossils that need to be identified in a 2-dimentional view, based on several morphological parameters, the image recognition software needs to identify fossils from different angles, poorly preserved and fragmented fossils, as well as partially hidden or folded fossils. A species can also have a morphological range and evolution. This morphological and evolutionary complexity is the base for the research needed to develop the AI software.

Within this project we intend to establish if the digital scans of the biostratigraphical samples have the resolution needed to be used for quantitative analyses, we will also develop a sample preparation process to reliably produce the best digital samples possible. We will then design and develop an Artificial intelligence software for clustering and classification of microfossils based on deep-learning based algorithms for detection and segmentation of microfossils and algorithms based on autoencoders for extracting features predictive of different fossil types.",Næringsliv,Næringsliv,5522000,Thomas Løkken Rustad,APPLIED PETROLEUM TECHNOLOGY AS,Oslo

317900,Drilling Systems Interoperability Demonstrations,2021,2022,"In order to enable and demonstrate interoperability between drilling systems, the project will evolve in parallel along two axes.
First, an infrastructure will be developed to enable meaningful exchange of drilling data. We will build upon the work done by NORCE during the DDHub project, and involve several actors of the drilling industry in this activity. This will be achieved by close cooperation with existing initiatives (such a D-WIS) that will provide the appropriate context for this collaborative effort. Reference implementations will be developed to facilitate the adoption from the industry of those new technologies.
Then, virtual demonstrations will be made that illustrate the benefits of using semantical integration of various systems. The different project partners will provide commercial applications that will be modified to account for the newly developed system, and several new applications will be developed to emphasize the advantages of including interoperability from the design phase. Those proof-of-concept demonstrations shall take place in a virtual environment, in order to facilitate the testing and validation work.",Næringsliv,Næringsliv,3750000,Benoit Daireaux,PREDIKTOR AS,Fredrikstad
317901,"An ""updated-while-drilling"" Advisory system.",2020,2022,"There is no tool in the market today able to provide an ""updated-while-drilling"" optimization of drilling parameters (flow, rotation speed and running speed) in real-time during operation and with the flexibility of using it on any existing legacy systems or modern systems. This tool will revolutionize in a national and international level the way of drilling wells for safer and optimal results.

Model based reasoning in Artificial Intelligence (AI) with a Digital Twin combined with Machine Learning (ML) and advanced 3D visualization is a key enabler for operation alerts and optimization. Multiple forward-looking and what-ifs are done in real-time to find optimal parameters for flow, rotation and running speed. A Diagnostics module detects abnormalities and triggers safeguards.

Auto-configuration and auto-calibration are key elements for Drilling Advisory system and deployment without need for back-office support. The personnel involved in the operation (drilling contractor, service provider and operator) will be able to quickly give necessary operational input and then the system will be auto-calibrated during the operation.

The system can be easily integrated with other systems via various API available options. The common option is to automatically read the data from the company real-time data store or drilling control system. The system will then calculate the results every time-step and send the results back to the company’s real-time data store and/or Drilling Control System. This also means that models are updated every time-step to reflect the well behaviour in real-time. 

The front-end, to be used in front of the Driller and other directly involved personnel, consists of an open system capable of real-time 3D visualization of the drilling process (including tripping, casing/liner running and cementing). Data from other 3rd party systems can be visualized together with the Drilling advisory system recommendations to get the “full picture.",Næringsliv,Næringsliv,4001000,Sven Inge Ødegård,EDRILLING AS,Stavanger

In the SmartACT project, an innovative and non-intrusive long-life sensor system for online condition assessment and monitoring will be developed and tested for installation inside 420 kV oil-filled cable terminations, which are the components most prone to failure. This novel sensor system will provide continuous feedback concerning the condition of the cable terminals, thus allowing for mitigation procedures to be enacted when necessary hence avoiding disruption of supply. The sensor system is expected to increase security of energy supply by assessing temperature, humidity, pressure, and partial discharges (PDs) combined with a new digitized machine-learning-assisted assessment methodology.

Denne formen for ansettelser medfører en rekke beslutnings- og bekreftelsesfeil hos de som ansetter – noe som fører til at man ikke finner den beste kandidaten bland jobbsøkerne. I tillegg vil beslutnings- og bekreftelsesfeil kunne lede til kostbare feilansettelser. 

EBBER vil bidra til å effektivisere og forbedre ansettelsesprosesser ved at EBBER reduserer gapet mellom forskning og praksis i HR-feltet. Dette er viktig da bedrifter som følger en state-of-the-art best practice har et betydelig bedre økonomisk resultat. 

Etter rekrutteringsfasen vil EBBER forbedre seleksjon av jobbsøkere ved å anvende de beste psykometriske testene som i størst grad forutsier jobbprestasjon, turnover og jobbfravær. I tillegg vil EBBER – som den første applikasjonen i verden - sammenstille resultatet av disse testene til en entydig rangering av jobbsøkere slik at arbeidsgivere ikke må gjøre dette selv. EBBER vil også bruke maskinlæring/kunstig intelligens for å kontinuerlig kunne oppdatere og forbedre sine algoritmer slik at algoritmene tilpasser seg særegne suksessfaktorer i den enkelte organisasjon og passer med virksomhetenes personellstrategiske fokus.

Such a process will in turn give us the possibility to exploit freely available earth observations to determine deviations in electromagnetic emissions which can indicate a roof leakage, a solar panel failure, or urban hotspots. The processing of these data today is time consuming, demands expensive use of resources, and generates too much data to be feasibly handled by human beings. The project aims to reduce the human workload in sorting earth observation data for insurers, property investors and the bank sector. 

Today, financial risk of a property asset is based on empirical data of material cost and lifespan, experience and area statistics. The project aims to enable insurers, property management, investors and other stakeholders to proactively protect and manage their assets by using the rapidly available metrics for maintenance cost budgeting, insurance risk assessment and factual depreciation of property value. The product will be a business intelligence tool presented in an online portal, with multiple subscription and single purchase options.

The processed data will be made available together with a simple cost index factor for the asset owner or the insurance provider. In the first iteration of the portal, data will be available for compact materials in roof structures and solar panels. The portal will be available with tier membership ranging from single property and private cooperatives, professional property managers to large enterprises. All memberships will give different options and analysis detail level.

There are over 20 000 ICD-10 diagnosis codes for Norwegian divided into 22 chapters. The codes are hierarchical in 3 levels and each code has a textual description. One or several of these ICD-10 codes are assigned to the patient's discharge summary by the physician both for medical and for administrative purposes. The process of assigning codes is difficult and time consuming and it is also shown that up to 41 percent of the manually assigned main diagnosis maybe wrong or sometimes missing.

The CAC tool will learn from previously manually coded discharges summaries, patient notes both free text and structured information such as laboratory results, blood values, etc and assign ICD-codes to unseen discharge summaries. The CAC tool will use Artificial Intelligence methods such as Natural Language Processing and Deep Learning techniques to learn and predict codes. Ranked ICD-10 code suggestions will be presented to the physician such that he or she can can select among them and assign the correct code.

This will enable fast and high quality semi automatic ICD-10 coding. The CAC tool can also be used for assessing coding quality on historical data for hospital management and health authorities.

The CAC tool will reduce coders workload and improve overall code quality. High-quality codes enable efficient data reuse, promoting fast knowledge generation in healthcare, thereby laying foundations for personalized medicine, more efficient health management, and, subsequently, higher quality of care.

Oppgavene som er tenkt løst krever mye mer enn rene tekstsøk, systemet må ta hensyn til tekstlige sammenhenger og grafiske formateringer.   Til dette skal avanserte metoder innen kunstig intelligens brukes.   Kunstig intelligens brukes i stadig flere sammenhenger, men det finnes ikke kommersielt tilgjengelige løsninger som har tilfredsstillende funksjonalitet for oppgavene som er tenkt løst av prosjektet.

Et eksempel er på en slik problemstilling, er å finne informasjon som er i konflikt med EUs GDPR bestemmelser om datasikkerhet og personvern.  Det kreves at bedrifter og andre organisasjoner fjerner informasjon som er i strid med disse bestemmelsene.  Å finne slik informasjon blant store mengder med dokumenter er svært arbeidskrevende hvis en ikke har gode verktøy som hjelpemiddel, slike verktøy finnes ikke i dag.  Andre oppgaver som kan løses er å finne klausuler i kontakter som ikke lenger er lovlige pga nye regler og dermed gjør hele kontraktene ugyldige.

Noe skiller dette prosjektet ut fra mange andre kunstig intelligensprosjekter ifm informasjonsuttrekk er at det er mål at brukere uten spesialkunnskap om kunstig intelligens selv skal kunne sette opp nye avanserte søk.

Advances in sensor technologies and genomics offer possibilities for faster breeding of new cultivars and more site-specific crop management. PhenoCrop seeks to increase the sustainability and productivity of Norwegian wheat production by developing new high-throughput phenotyping tools to be used in plant breeding and precision agriculture. A robotic platform will be adapted for close-up imaging in field trials while drones fitted with multispectral and hyperspectral cameras will be used to gather crop canopy data in a fast and efficient manner. Specific algorithms including machine learning models will be applied to estimate important agronomic traits and predict yield performance. Deep learning object detection methods will be applied to develop image-based automated solutions for Fusarium head blight (FHB), which is a particular challenging disease to evaluate by visual scoring. A database system with user-friendly tools for efficient data management and visualization will be developed. Big data in breeding and agriculture will be utilized by applying novel concepts of combining crop performance in large-scale plant breeding nurseries across years and locations with yield mapping in farmers’ fields coupled with multispectral drone imaging data. This will help us to disentangle the genotype-by-environment interactions, develop better tools for predicting performance of new cultivars and helping farmers to apply site-specific crop management to increase yield stability, productivity and profitability. The work will be carried on in close cooperation with plant breeders (Graminor), farmers, extension service (NLR), and drone service providers (Unmanned), and in collaboration with world-leading expertise on statistical modeling (CIMMYT), and application of deep learning for image analysis in plant breeding (University of Minnesota).",Universiteter,UoH-sektor,10400000,Morten Lillemo,NORGES MILJØ- OG BIOVITENSKAPELIGE UNIVERSITET (NMBU),Ås

2. Research the behaviour of the rock mass to stress related instability along the waterway system under the condition of frequent cycles of load/unload scenarios that is being emerged and will be the operation scenario in the days to come due to different renewable sources of energy in the grid and its relationship with the in-situ stress.

320717,The balancing act: Biologically driven rapid-response automation of production conditions in recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS),2021,2025,"The world is searching for sustainable solutions to produce healthy food. Aquaculture has been tasked to meet this demand. Recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) have many sustainability advantages over open sea cages e.g. no interaction with wild fish, reduced water use and collection of waste. However, the potential of RAS to alleviate the demand for healthy fish is hindered by reoccurring unpredictable production losses, high costs and operational risk. While digitalisation and automation are on the forefront of priorities to improve production efficiency and reduce the environmental impacts of aquaculture, no production system has the same potential to exploit these enabling technologies as RAS. New automated approaches, making use of sensors and control algorithms, are required to realise the sustainability potential of RAS. The RAS 4.0 project brings together a multidisciplinary team to produce balanced and bio-inspired control loops on the most critical operations, namely water quality, feeding efficiency and energy optimisation. These loops will be integrated into a digital twin that will focus on optimising RAS performance and will be validated during RAS operations. The project utilises the expertise of industry partners established technologies and expertise from sensor, data standards and integration. Together with leading research partners in RAS technology, fish physiology, behaviour, welfare, machine learning, data analytics, smart cameras and computer vision they will work to develop smart digital approaches that seamlessly connect and optimise the physical, digital, and biological world. The RAS 4.0 project will create highly valuable knowledge that can be used by aquaculture and industry suppliers working to maximise the sustainability of these operations.

Our research aims to study the appropriateness of using machine intelligence, also referred to as narrow artificial intelligence, in police operations to fulfill their mandate, and to foster human rights. Our interdisciplinary study comprises perspectives from the social and computing sciences, and works towards a balanced and responsible socio-technical approach in smart-city policing, where citizens can trust the police, and both co-create a safe and prosperous environment for everyone.
The Nordic countries and Norway in particular have a long history of implementing organisations and policies for the benefit of mankind, i.e. with the founding of the UN in 1949. With our research we are miming to contribute to provide policies and technologies for using artificial intelligence in policing, to engage citizens and gain their trust in advanced technology support, and to minimize possibilities that machine intelligence is used to infringe fairness and freedom of citizens, and their human rights.

AI has the ability to acquire, process, interpret and learn from different types of data, and make autonomous decisions. In doing so, it can automate some of the tasks performed by humans and thereby threatens existing human jobs. The potential to obscure the borders between biological, digital and physical aspects of the contemporary world explicitly increases the level of fear and anxiety of frontline workers. 
However, focussing only on AI, while ignoring human intelligence leaves great potential aside. While AI outperforms humans on objective and structured  tasks, they can only learn from the past. Humans excel in creative and affective aspect, e.g.,  managing relationships, providing customized solutions or developing and experimenting with innovative ideas.
While AI implications are heavily discussed in business and management literature, the implications and requirements for human-AI collaboration are still at its infancy stage. Previous research primarily focuses on technological and economic aspects of AI. However, research on the organizational transformation that is shaped by human-AI collaboration requires further theorizing and empirical evidence.
In this project, we plan to work on several goals while conducting a series of case studies. First, we contemplate to extend our understanding of how human-AI collaboration transforms job characteristics and organizational routines. Particularly, we will investigate the complementary benefits of human-AI collaboraiton for service work.

supply chain, but the need for change is especially pronounced in design and management of production and assembly systems. To become an ETO supplier of customized production and assembly systems often entails a
complete transformation of the company. Industry 4.0 can support this transformation thanks to the digital technologies
such as Cyber-Physical Systems, Internet of Things (IoT), Internet of Services (IoS), Robotics, Big Data, Cloud Manufacturing and Augmented Reality. However, such transformation, together with integrating of the
machines which have already been in use, into a innovative production and assembly system, is challenging.
In this connection, the following main challenges will be faced: 
1. How to design and implement innovative customized production and assembly systems,
2. Planning of customized production and assembly systems in the era of big data,
3. How to integrate analogous production equipment into innovative production and assembly line with minimal losses,

The NewbornTime project will provide a tool for quality improvement of newborn resuscitation both at a macro level, challenging current guidelines, and at a micro level providing a debriefing and quality improvement tool. Ultimately, this can have a significant impact in reducing long-term damage and save lives.

The project aims to utilize video recordings from births and newborn resuscitation situations to develop an Artificial Intelligence (AI) based system, NewbornTimeline, for automatic timeline generation of time of birth as well as potential resuscitation activities like ventilation, stimulation, suction, and the number of health care providers involved. The system input will be based on thermal video from the delivery room and RGB (+ thermal) video from the resuscitation table.
NewbornTime will use thermal cameras in the delivery room and develop video processing algorithms to accurately detect the time of birth. Potential obstacles between newborns and cameras require multiple thermal cameras and real-world data  to develop robust algorithms. 
The project aims to explore semi-supervised learning of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for partly un-labeled and untrimmed videos for activity recognition during newborn resuscitation, as labeling of activities will be both time consuming and have privacy issues. There will also be a focus on solutions that can adapt to on-site environments, since variations between hospitals in different countries can be extensive.

Mange registeringer gjøres fremdeles manuelt ute på veien gjennom inspeksjoner, eller gjennom manuell vurdering av bilder som tas en gang per året i registreringssystemet «Via Photo».  En annen utfordring er at tidsoppløsningen (en gang per år) av billedtaking er for sjelden til å sette i gang tidsriktig vedlikehold. Mange skadeprosesser på en vei kan skje innen noen få uker og problemene blir ikke oppdaget tidsnok i dag og dette fører til at skadene kan utvikle seg ytterligere før vi setter inn tiltak. En tredje utfordring for oss er å fremskaffe dokumentasjon i erstatningssaker (typisk knuste frontruter, og lakkskade og skader på veitutstyr (rekkverk, skilt etc). I dag bruker vi uforholdsmessig mye tid på å skaffe informasjon i slike saker.  Innovasjonsidéen er å lage et system som 1) automatisk og minst daglig tar bilder av fylkesveier, 2) automatisk identifiserer skader og slitasje av veibanen og skader/feil på rekkverk, 3) automatisk klassifiserer dette i en tilstandsklasse, og 4) aggregerer informasjonen i en GIS applikasjon.

Hovedmålet med innovasjonsprosjektet er å lage en digitalt støttet plattform for tverrsektorielt samarbeid for arbeidet med å redusere antall ulykker og konsekvensene av ulykker med fritidsbåter.

Fritidsbåtplattformen vil bestå av følgende fire delinnovasjoner:
1: En prototyp av en tverrsektoriell digital plattform basert blant annet stordata og maskinlæring for effektiv registrering, kopling og bearbeidelse av data knyttet  til risiko for fritidsbåtsulykker

321033,Lekkasjereduksjon i Norges drikkevannsnett,2021,2025,"Fagfeltet «lekkasjereduksjon» er under stor utvikling. Tallene hentet fra den nasjonale KOSTRA databasen for 2015 til og med 2019 viser et gjennomsnittlig vanntap på ca. 30 % fra norske drikkevannsnett. Størrelsen på vanntapet viser hvor mye av det vannet som hentes ut fra drikkevannskildene, renses og sendes ut via ledningsnettet, som forsvinner på veien til forbrukerne via utette ledninger. Ifølge en sammenligning av Europeiske land så ligger Norge blant de fem landene i Europa med høyest vanntap fra drikkevannsnettet. Store vanntap fra drikkevannsledninger har flere negative effekter og konsekvenser, blant annet knyttet til hygienisk sikkerhet, unødvendige kostnader, og negativ klimapåvirkning. Lekkasjene må derfor reduseres. 

Til daglig utføres det i kommunenorge analyse og vurdering av potensielle vannlekkasjer med påfølgende reparasjoner. Med dagens tilgjengelige teknologi finner man en del vannlekkasjer, men ikke alle. F.eks. er det mindre kontinuerlige vannlekkasjer, såkalte bakgrunnslekkasjer, som ikke kan lyttes opp (så lett) med tilgjengelig utstyr. Det antas at lekkasjevolumet fra slike bakgrunnslekkasjer er relativt høy. Dette ønsker man å gjøre noe med ved å invitere bransjen, akademia og ledningseiere for teste ut nye teknologier, og utvikle metoder og verktøy som er praktisk lett anvendbare. Den overordnede hensikte er å øke mulighetene i kommunenes verktøykasse for lekkasjereduksjon, og å bidra til økt samarbeid innad i bransjen. Dette prosjektet vil derfor komme bransjen og ledningseiere til nytte, noe som er til det beste for våre abonnenter.",Øvrige offentlige,Øvrige,7000000,Stian Bruaset,OSLO KOMMUNE VANN- OG AVLØPSETATEN,Oslo
321035,Geohazard Survey from Air – remote decision support with focus on avalanche applications,2021,2024,"Every year in Norway, geohazards pose a serious threat to the transport network. Road closures caused by snow avalanches, landslides, and rockfalls incur high economic costs and greatly impact the reliability of Norway’s critical transport network. The GEOSFAIR project owner, the Norwegian Public Roads Administration (NPRA), is responsible for maintaining important routes that are threatened by snow avalanches. Keeping these roads open requires costly operations to assess and mitigate snow avalanche risk. The widespread coverage of the transport network and growing volumes of travellers, as well as climate changes that have resulted in more severe, more frequent, and less predictable geohazards, have increased the NPRA’s mitigation costs. In addition, closing transport infrastructure for extensive periods has severe societal and financial consequences because in many places there is little or no road redundancy. Mitigation measures tend to be reactive, based on immediate risk rather than on proactive monitoring. Therefore, there is an urgent need for more cost-effective and innovative methods for assessing and mitigating geohazards along NPRA’s network. 
Rising geohazard assessment costs, in combination with a climate-impacted, changing risk picture, are the motivation for the GEOSFAIR application. This proposal recognizes the growing capabilities of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS), payloads to evaluate snow conditions, and software to use those data to support decision making. The NPRA has identified the following research and innovation areas for GEOSFAIR that will significantly create value: 1) Utilization of new, automated UAS technology to survey hazardous terrain while reducing the need for costly manned helicopter flights and manual observations; 2) Improvement in the accuracy and reliability of geohazards data; and 3) Implementation of structured digitization strategies to remotely monitor avalanche sites and to support the NPRA ‘s roadway closure decisions.",Øvrige offentlige,Øvrige,5950000,Tore Humstad,STATENS VEGVESEN,Lillehammer

I tillegg yter etaten veiledning og servicetjenester til helseaktørene og skal sikre effektiv ressursutnyttelse i forvaltning av helserefusjonsområdet. 
Generelt kreves det at oppgjørskrav til Helfo skal dokumenteres, og helseaktørenes refusjonsrett blir kontrollert når kravene behandles i Helfos oppgjørssystem. Ved å  automatisere prosesser som i stor grad er manuelle og tidkrevende vil Helfo kunne jobbe mer effektivt og i nærmere sanntid og kunne avdekke feil raskere.

321047,"Gameplay prediction of reading difficulties (GAMEPLAY).
A machine learning approach based on school starters serious gameplay",2021,2024,"Research has established the importance of early literacy interventions to help struggling readers to overcome their reading difficulties. Early intervention for children with reading difficulties (RD) is therefore a societal priority.  Early reading intervention requires early identification. However, identifying school starters who risk facing RD has remained an error-prone process.

In Norway, the national quality monitoring system has no validated tool available for the identification of struggling readers at school start.  Our aim in GAMEPLAY is to develop a non-intrusive method for accurate early detection of risk for developing reading difficulties in first-grade school children. We do this through innovative use of gameplay data obtained from the child's interaction with a digital reading game.  The children will play the reading game daily during a five-week period during the first months of school. The data contain detailed recordings of each game session in terms of, e.g., response times, item clicked, number of correct responses and number of incorrect responses.
Hence, through playing an enjoyable digital reading game, we obtain rich data which carries information about the child's developmental trajectories of perceptual, cognitive and linguistic skills. This data will be subjected to state-of-the-art  AI/machine learning algorithms in order to detect whether the child may be at risk for developing reading difficulties. 

To train and evaluate various machine learning algorithms, we will initially use high-quality data already obtained as part of the On Track research project. In order to train the more powerful  AI algorithms, this dataset is too small. We therefore will collect a larger dataset, involving many more participants. 

Our project will also specify how the predictive model may be integrated with the game platform for the benefit of teachers.",Øvrige offentlige,Øvrige,5525000,Njål Foldnes,OSLO KOMMUNE UTDANNINGSETATEN,Oslo
321078,Real-time condition and collision risk monitoring for railway infrastructure using fibre optic networks,2021,2024,"The Rail-DAS project  aims to exploit the free capacity of fibre optic communication cables currently being installed in the ground alongside the Bane NOR network, to listen for characteristic acoustic signatures of condition risk (generated as a train passes) and collision risk (generated by objects moving nearby the rails).  At the heart of the concept lies Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS). DAS consists of a passive optical fibre, that can be 10s of km in length, and an “interrogator” box at one end. The interrogator sends laser pulses along the fibre, and a small amount of the light is scattered from each location along the fibre back to the interrogator. The optical path experienced by the backscatter is modulated by acoustic fields, allowing for disturbances to be spatially resolved to within a few meters along the entire length of the fibre. A profound advantage of distributed fibre optic technology is that the low-cost passive fibre itself functions as the sensor. Furthermore, in contrast to a large numbers of individual point sensors requiring individual power sources, a distributed fibre optic sensor requires power only at the interrogator end of the fibre.  Unlike their electrical counterparts, fibre optic sensors are immune to electromagnetic interference, a valuable property for electrically powered railroads like in Norway. By the development and application of machine learning algorithms alongside DAS,  Rail-DAS will allow for near-continuous condition and collision risk monitoring over the entire rail network, and allow for preventative maintenance and other interventions to be carried out before problems become critical.   The main elements of Rail-DAS are:

1) Real-time, network wide detection and location of rail infrastructure damage using DAS
2) Real-time, network wide detection and location of rolling stock with wheel damage using DAS
3) Real-time, network wide detection and location of objects on the rail line using DAS",Øvrige offentlige,Øvrige,6550000,Peter Thomas,BANE NOR SF,Hamar

Dette påfører veinett, miljø og samfunn stor belastning.

FoU-prosjektet Last Mile 2025 har til hensikt å bygge en kommersiell og teknisk plattform som støtter opp under fremtidig behov for hjemlevering, samtidig som de transportpolitiske mål om et transportsystem med bedre fremkommelighet, sikkerhet og/eller reduserte utslipp møtes. Videre bidra til at man opprettholder en konkurransedyktig og bærekraftig logistikknæring uten å gå på akkord med arbeidsrett og dårlige vilkår for ansatte i næringen.

Distribution Innovation AS har 20 års track record i å omsette FOU prosjekter til verdiskapning og verdi for samfunn. DI ble etablert i 2001 av Aftenposten for å realisere idéer om drastisk innovasjon innen distribusjon av medieprodukter ved bruk av IKT. Ved hjelp av flere FoU-prosjekter delvis finansiert av Forskningsrådet er DI nå markedsledende i Norden når det gjelder IKT-baserte tjenester for optimalisert planlegging og styring av ""last mile""-distribusjon.

The European construction industry is urgently lacking clear, centralised access to information about secondary building material availability in their area, due to the fragmentation and inconsistency with which these public data are captured and stored. This makes building planning with quality secondary building materials time and cost-intensive for stakeholders, in turn making it difficult to comply with the EU’s Waste Directive of 70% recycled/re-used building materials. 
Our young, multi-award-winning company is planning to launch a €2,420,750.00 project with the EIC over 24 months to build a breakthrough innovation for the whole of Europe using artificial intelligence and machine learning that will extract, read, evaluate, and forecast quantities of secondary building materials for the user, making future planning for property developers seamless through our platform.

The solution will make it easy for the dental industry worldwide to use this as a complete solution on an everyday basis for decision support in oral disease diagnostics. The prevalence of non-communicable diseases particularly oral diseases are increasing worldwide including Norway. In Norway, every year more than 75% of adults visit their dentists for annual oral health check-up. We need to develop and integrate new research based computational models with the ability to automatically analyze data to retrieve useful information to aid clinicians in accurate diagnostics and decision making. Hence, we think modern-day supervised machine learning technique(s) may offer the promise to potentially solve this important issue. In dental science, a panoramic dental X-ray image (Orthopantomogram, known as OPG) captures both maxillary and mandibular dental arches and the surrounding structures including hypoid bone. We believe that implementing artificial intelligence based algorithms can reduce the rate of diagnosing false negatives, especially effective for inexperienced dentists for decision making.

321409,Genes2behave - Using vision-related behavioral traits in commercial breeding programs for pigs.,2021,2025,"Poor economy and increased consumer demand for animal welfare friendly meat production has changed the framework for pig production. The farms are bigger with high animal turn-over. Manual work is automatized, the group sizes are increasing, and the human-animal interactions are reduced. These factors are all creating the framework for the environment pigs are kept in. It is therefore crucial that breeding companies have information about behaviour to evolve the pig breeds to be calm, social and well-functioning in their social environment. This means to minimize antagonistic and damaging behaviours such as aggression and tail biting and stimulate to optimal behaviours such as play, positive interactions and exploration. Advances in vision technologies, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have offered new opportunities to measure behavioural traits. In this project we aim to measure behavioural traits in pigs that influence animal welfare, production efficiency and product quality in order to establish a routine pipeline for implementation of behavioural traits in our breeding program. This will be achieved using novel techniques within artificial intelligence, machine learning and digitization of pig behaviour through videos. From videos, the project shall identify novel behavioural traits relevant for genomic selection. The project will therefore develop models for efficient storage of informative images from video and develop models for predicting different behavioural traits. When the automated recording of behaviour is established and available - genomic analyses of the new traits will be performed to identify heritable traits relevant for implementation in the breeding program. Introducing a novel digital pipeline from video to breeding value for behavioural traits is essential in terms of improving the animal welfare and profit in pig production, but also our breeding programs and competetive advantage in an international market.",Næringsliv,Næringsliv,6825000,Kristine Hov Martinsen,NORSVIN R&D AS,Hamar

Despite fact that Precision Cancer Medicine based on aberration-matched therapies has been demonstrated to provide significant clinical benefits, this is not universally available to most cancer patients. Many cancer drugs are ineffective for a large proportion of patients, 75% or more, consequently, millions of cancer patients are receiving treatments that give little more than unwanted and severe side effects.

In response to this, we want to develop Coremine Vitae, a biomedical intelligence system to identify the best possible treatment options to individual patients. The optimal personalized treatment strategy requires consideration of NGS analyses, other biomarkers, patient status, medical history, as well as patient preferences (side effects, mobility, etc.). While the present Coremine Vitae analysis process handles many steps manually, we aim to develop machine learning and big data analytics to identify and rank evidence and treatment options, and thus dramatically decrease the need for manual effort. In addition, the use of the system will improve process results by allowing more comprehensive searches and reduce the risk of bias. 

Through our partners, Haukeland University Hospital and Sykehuset Innlandet, we have access to patients needed to develop our system, and at the same time obtain clinical validation of the algorithms and resulting Coremine Vitae analysis reports.

321582,New Machine Learning Algorithms for the Calculation of Water Values,2021,2023,"In power markets featuring hydro generation such as the Nordic market, the optimal use of the available hydro power resource is essential to a well-functioning power system, in order to achieve desired environmental goals and to maximise the socio-economic benefit of the power system. Over many decades the industry has developed the concept of “water values” as the basis for conducting this optimisation. A reservoir’s water value is defined as the marginal expected benefit (e.g. market income, lower costs) of keeping the water in storage and saving it to generate electricity or provide power system services at some point in the future. Put simply, if the water value is higher than the benefit of using the water now it is optimal to keep it in storage, and if it is not the water should be used now. 

All actors - producers, grid operators, regulators, use and calculate water values to make bidding, operational and investment decisions. The methods used today to calculate these suffer from known computational limitations that reduce their accuracy and increase time-to-solve. The increase in renewable generation and market complexity (e.g. via new reserve markets) additionally challenge existing methods.

There is an unmet need in the power industry for better methods to calculate water values that better capture realistic market, geographical and time detail, a full range of uncertainties and their impact, and can calculate these quickly. Our proposed project will research and develop innovative machine learning (ML) models to calculate water values for use in both operative applications and market simulation models. Our approach will build on recent developments in reinforcement and adversarial learning, to develop a system that “learns” how to optimally value (operate) storage hydro, and that uses the computational advantages of machine learning to do so at an increased level of detail and accuracy.",Næringsliv,Næringsliv,4210000,Gavin Bell,OPTIMEERING AS,Oslo
321620,"AI4FISH - AI for sustainability in marine recreational fishing participation:  
Scalable spatio-temporally resolved ML models",2021,2023,"Recreational fishing (RF) involves at least 226 million participants worldwide, it generates an annual economic value of 5.9 billion euros in EU and 29 billion euros in the US. Until recent years, studies show that RF has nearly invisibly contributed to approximately 12% of global fishing removal; and it has caused 27% to declining in stock of two endangered species. We have identified 5 main barriers in achieving sustainability in RF:
- No or limited real-world georeferenced and time-tagged catch data. 
- No or limited tools for monitoring and control RF activities.
- No or limited communication channels.
- Limited knowledge about where to fish.
- Post-reactive, not predictive or proactive.
The FiskHer App could be an good tool in tackling the 5 barriers towards sustainable RF.
We develop a new digital service – FiskHer.ai – leveraging state-of-the-art data science and machine learning technologies for promoting and facilitating of sustainable marine recreational fishing. The idea is to discover scalable machine learned models that accurately predict most probable RF spots with high spatial and temporal resolution in Norway and worldwide. We achieve this via synergized transformation of the domain expertise earned in field owned by FiskHer AS to machine learned models, which are incrementally learned continuously lifelong with user contributed new data. The expected results of the project are a new integrated large dataset with validated labels, new underwater 360 degree video and hyperspectral imaging data for a few fishing spots, software for data integration and automated machine learning, scalable machine learned models for accurate and spatio-temporal resolved predictions. This innovation is most important to us because:
1. it allows us to go from static to dynamic areas.
2. It gives us a wonderful tool that will save us years of manual registration.
It will thus be cost-effective and innovative for us, and enable us to deliver many years ahead of schedule.",Næringsliv,Næringsliv,4745000,Boyan Yuan,FISKHER AS,Lillesand

The project aims to use social robots to teach language skills combined with social and communication skills to children with ASD.
The project will create and evaluate the RObot Supported education for children with ASD (ROSA) toolbox with three parts: Content Creator, for easily creating tailored one-on-one lessons for the unique needs of each child with ASD; Robot Software runs lesson content customized to the robot's capabilities; and  Review, for following progress and input for the next lesson. Rosa toolbox targets no specific robot, but content will adjust to a robot's capabilities.
The project employs a sociocultural approach with experts in social robotics, education, and ASD and conduct technological and interdisciplinary research in abstracting robot capabilities, robot-assisted language learning, customizing and personalizing technology for education, and education content for children with ASD. The final prototype will be evaluated in a year-long trial with over 50 children with ASD using the social robot in sessions at school several times a week. The children's language, social, and communication abilities will be compared to at least 50 children with ASD from previous years not in the trial. Items measured include children's motivation and engagement when working during the sessions. Quantitative and qualitative methods will be used and ethical challenges related to use of social robots for children with ASD will be addressed.
Beyond helping children with ASD develop skills, the project will create knowledge about how the effect of embodiment, social robots, language learning, robot training, how social robots can improve language, communication and social skills of children with ASD. The toolbox can be further developed and commercialized to include other content and target other groups for learning.",Teknisk-industrielle institutter,Instituttsektor,12000000,Kristin Skeide Fuglerud,NORSK REGNESENTRAL,Oslo
322149,Improve detectability for trustworthiness assessment of concrete structure inspection in ultrasound by AI method,2021,2023,"The first step in the research will be to properly understand the problem at hand, the Elop challenges. This will be followed by a comprehensive literature review, and identification of various metrics to compare against a ground truth in image segmentation in order to generate reliable result. 

Elop is searching for AI techniques (machine learning, pattern recognition and deep learning) to improve the detection capability of COBRI scanner. The second step will be to investigate a detection model based on deep learning neural networks. 

To conduct the research, we firstly need to create a very large dataset of various synthetic cases with exactly known ground truth. Namely, a wave simulation tool such as SimSonic is used to simulate realistic cases and measure RF data for each receiver. Using Elop’s beamforming techniques, we can create synthetic images from this RF data. Such images can be validated by comparison with images from the COBRI scanner, where the synthetic and real images are based on the same concrete structure. In the next step, we use supervised learning to train a deep learning-based image segmentation algorithm to reproduce the ground truth from the synthetic images. This leads to acquiring a large dataset of various real cases with known ground truth, measured with the COBRI scanner. Finally, we take the model trained on synthetic data and use transfer learning techniques to re-train it on real data to be able to reproduce ground truth from real images. The methodologies will be published as papers.",Næringsliv,Næringsliv,2382000,Kamal Raj Chapagain,ELOP AS,Oslo

We expect findings will be transferable to other medical screening programs.

Breast cancer is the most common cancer and the leading cause of cancer death among women worldwide. Early detection of breast cancer through screening is recommended by international health organizations to reduce this mortality. It is considered to expand the screening program by examining more women. The use of AI can lead to a larger capacity to do screening and detect cancers, reduce overdiagnosis, and by this save lives and give new opportunities for improved health services.

Furthermore, we need to understand the effects of using AI in this context. To address this, the project will involve AI experts, medical experts, organizers and practitioners within mammographic screening to create a strong interdisciplinary team.

The main novelties of the proposed project are:
* Develop methods that can handle domain shifts without costly annotation of new data. Current methods have problems handing images from different equipment, operators and cohorts. 
* Exploitation of time series in AI breast cancer screening. Radiologists exploit prior mammograms when doing their manual reading, while it is rarely used in current AI-based models.
* Interpretation of predictions from AI breast cancer models such that radiologists can understand the predictions. This gives trust and makes it easier to improve the AI method and combine this with manual reading by radiologists.
* Find the differences in the prediction between radiologist and AI both statistically and using data collected in the screening program as a basis when we combine the two methods. 
* Develop AI systems that is usable for radiologists in mammographic screening utilizing the strength of each approach. A new screening program should give better predictions and use less radiology resources.",Teknisk-industrielle institutter,Instituttsektor,12000000,Marit Holden,NORSK REGNESENTRAL,Oslo
322473,Towards Cognitive and Autonomous Smart City Services: The Case of Low-Latency Air Quality Management,2021,2025,"Existing air quality (AQ) monitoring and management (AQMS) methods and evolving modelling practices across Norwegian and European cities have achieved significant improvements of AQ but further progress is needed due to some quality-driven requirements, such as low-latency AQ prediction. This can only be achieved by intelligent data processing at multiple levels of granularity. To this end, affordable, effective and intelligent tools are needed that utilize the current advances in digitization of all spheres of society, providing radical innovation of air quality management. The AirQMan project promises autonomous computational methods and techniques that can be used to develop such solutions, and has the potential for opening up a new era in air quality management.  Our strong belief is that such a system can be realized across the Edge-Fog-Cloud continuum, extending data processing and computational intelligence from the Cloud to multiple levels of Fog nodes towards the edge of the network. 

The project will develop AirQDM – a novel data processing design model that will autonomously determine the optimal data fusion processing flow, the right data sources, and the right trained deep learning (DL) model for maximizing the accuracy of a prediction related to an AQ request. A second innovation of the project, AirQWare will determine (predict) the optimal distributed deployment for an efficient computation of the DL model while satisfying requirements on accuracy and latency, and adapt the deployment of the DL model during runtime as necessary to maintain accuracy and latency requirements. 

By applying the AirQMan approach, the new generation of AQMS will provide: i) low-latency data validation and fusion to increase the accuracy of air quality evaluation, and to support intelligent services, respectively, and ii) cognitive decision making with various degrees of autonomy enabling low-latency actuations of  AQ mitigations.",Universiteter,UoH-sektor,12000000,Amir Taherkordi,Institutt for informatikk,Oslo

PRELONG will showcase the capability of AI to reliably predict effects of interventions to the transport systems (as road capacity increases and changes to the road toll structure) and that much faster (in a few seconds) than current transport models. Fast computation times and easy access are potential game changers in how we utilize transport models for effective transport planning. 
The overall data flow includes 1) Establishing synthetic travel populations 2) Run agent-based traffic simulations and iteratively calibrate underlying parameters in the simulator c) Train a binarized DNN on the simulated traffic data d) Implement the trained DNN within an open-access and user-friendly GIS-based sketch planning tool.
The scenarios of the multiple runs with the traffic simulator (MATSim) will be careful predefined by an experimental design varying a) road toll structure b) speed limit c) road capacity on single road network links d) population in different zones in the Oslo metropolitan area. To ground DNN predictions to the empirical real world, we calibrate the detailed traffic simulator against real data. This enables the simulator to credibly predict a wide range of future scenarios at a high level of resolution. These simulator predictions are then used to train a neural network that can quickly approximate complex future scenarios in a sketch planning setup. We plan to use binarized neural networks analysed and interpreted using an exact encoding into propositional logic.

322744,Autonomous robot missions with AI-based planning and acting,2021,2024,"In ROBPLAN we will move the research front by developing methods for AI-based planning and acting - AI planning - to enable robust autonomous robot missions. We will demonstrate results on industrial use cases with mobile manipulators and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) for inspection and maintenance (I&M). The global I&M market is estimated at 450 billion EUR.

The industry and public sector are pushing for robotic solutions with high level of autonomy that can operate safely and efficiently in increasingly complex operations. And great strives have been done to realize stand-alone automated functions for robot acting (e.g., grasping, collision avoidance), as well as for high-level automated planning of missions. However, even for simple missions, the planning complexity quickly explodes, and high-level planning is often performed as an ""offline"" process where the world is assumed to be static. To enable real-life fully autonomous single- and multi-robot missions, we need robots that can balance long-term planning with the ability to react to immediate events. To meet this need we will develop methods in the ROBPLAN project to tightly combine planning and acting by building on techniques from symbolic AI approaches enhanced by non-symbolic AI. Moreover, we will develop methods for distributed robot decision-making during planning and acting to enable multi-robot autonomous missions with and without humans in the loop. 

We will demonstrate results on I&M use cases within the oil and gas industry, but project results will also be applicable in other application domains where autonomous robots are increasingly deployed and can benefit from a higher level of autonomy in operations; agri-food, healthcare and manufacturing.

IFE har lang erfaring med å kombinere 3D-teknologi og optimaliseringsalgoritmer for komplekse 3D-miljøer for kjernekraftindustrien. Forprosjektet skal teste ut om algoritmer er anvendbare og kan tilpasses miljøriktigprosjektering av bygninger, og legge grunnlag for et hovedprosjekt basert på funnene. Vi skal utforske bruk av algoritmer utviklet for optimal navigering i romlige modeller. Målet er å skape teknologi som evner å prosjektere mer bærekraftige bygg og anlegg for fremtidens bygde samfunn. Dagens metode for prosjektering av bygg og anlegg, baserer seg på tradisjonell «if, then else» metodisk oppbygging. Metoden stammer fra før vi la inn strøm, ventilasjon og vann i byggene våre og da en byggmester planla bygget og alt dette innebar av design, fremdriftsplanlegging og bygging.

Etterhvert har vi lagt inn mere avanserte løsninger for vann, strøm og ventilasjon i byggene våre. Dagens problem oppstår gjennom en ekstrem kompleksitet å optimalisere et bærekraftigdesign for å treffe disse behovene, en prosess som er utviklet for å løse mye enklere design og verktøy som ikke evner å håndtere den store mengden informasjon. Hvert år omsetter norske rådgivende ingeniører for ca. 25 MRD NOK i timerverk. Ofte kan bare det å fremskaffe et tverrfaglig design som er byggbart være det beste man klarer å oppnå.

Vi skal løse problemet ved å ta i bruk teknologi som er i stand til å lære av data for så å erstatte menneskelig beslutningstaking og dermed åpne opp for en transformasjon av den tradisjonelle prosjekteringsprosessen. Løsningen bygges på en kombinasjon av maskinlæring (kunstig intelligens), koding av logikk og matematisk optimalisering.

De seneste tiårene har det vært en kraftig utvikling av nye maskinlæringsmetoder. Mange av disse metodene har vist seg å være svært treffsikre, men ofte er det vanskelig å tolke og evaluere usikkerheten i disse metodene. Eiendomsverdi er pålagt å presentere en usikkerhetsgrad ved alle sine prediksjoner, og det første temaet for PhD-avhandlingen blir å utvikle et rammeverk for å evaluere usikkerheten i et estimat.

Today, information is sent from the near bit area of the drill string via mud-pulse telemetry. The signal rate for this form of telemetry is quite low. There are several drawbacks with this form of data transmission in addition to a low data rate: 
• Poor data quality 
• Limited number of sensors (a point in time and/or a point in the well) 
• Communication is unavailable under tripping/connection 
Wired drill pipe (WDP) [M. Reeves et. al. 2006], developed by NOV can greatly reduce the mentioned problems. Wired drill pipe breaks these constraints by having effectively continuous and multiple sensor measurements along the length of the wellbore [Sanna Z. et. al. 2016]. It has been long recognized that bad data quality is hampering our attempts to make use of the drilling data [Dan Sui, et. al. 2018]. Bad data obstruct integrated planning, burden collaborative environments and hamper workflows. Consistent data quality represents a challenge for the industry and represents a prerequisite for quality decision support. Both technological and systemic challenges must be addressed. If not, bad data quality will remain a barrier to safe and efficient drilling.
Method 2) Validation of WDP Data: Develop a method for the validation of the quality of the data while tripping data. Method 3) Quality of the sensors and sensor error will be addressed.

Today detection tests for AMR are routinely performed in microbiology labs by culturing (growing the microorganism) all over the country and the rest of the world. By culturing bacteria in the presence of antibiotics, you can determine which antibiotics they respond to, but it is a timely process (total time 3 – 4 days, up to a week)). In the AMR-Diag project, the use of rapid DNA extraction and sequencing in combination with bioinformatics and machine learning (ML) showed that the time from sample to answer can be readily decreased (> 18 hours) by this new method. The advantage of this is that the health care professional will have fast answers to the questions of what is the causative pathogen, which resistance genes are present in the sample, predict the phenotype, and thereby be helped in his/her decision on what antibiotic treatment to prescribe. This will, in turn, lead to the reduced and correct use of antibiotics, potentially save time and costs and most importantly, save lives. It will also contribute to preventing antibiotic resistance to increase a severe and life-threatening development that globally is out of control. This project will demonstrate the principles and methods from the AMR-Diag project in a proof of concept (PoC) study. This will include demonstrating the path from patient sample to sequence result and bioinformatic/ML interpretation. It will also include an alpha-version of such a software component. We propose to call this Rapid-Dig: Decision-making tool for rapid diagnostics of infection and antibiotic resistance.

The objective of this proposal is to develop a complementary set of beyond state-of-the-art, nanotechnology-driven tools for effective diagnostics of intratumor heterogeneity and subsequent therapy with tailored nanoparticles. The methods include (i) collection of molecular biopsies at improved spatial resolution (~100 µm) by tissue permeabilisation with electroporation, (ii) automation of sample preparation on electroporated extracts (RNA and proteins extraction) using centrifugal microfluidics and (iii) application of therapeutic gold and silica nanoparticles addressing the tumor subclonality.

322964,SCRIBE: Machine transcription of Norwegian conversational speech,2021,2025,"SCRIBE will develop a Norwegian speech-to-text transcription system capable of transcribing multi-party conversations. Speech technology has demonstrated a remarkable progress over the last decade, much due to the evolution of deep learning combined with the availability of massive amounts of speech and language data and high-performance computational resources. Although the amount of language data required for developing high performance speech technology is similar for all languages, irrespective of the number of speakers, products and services have become available that enable spoken communication with computers, even for smaller languages, like Norwegian. Examples include devices like Google Home, services like Siri and Google Voice Search, and voice command and dictation capabilities in recent versions of Windows and OS X.

Yet, for many real-life situations, current technology is not sufficiently advanced to be really useful. Issues like spontaneous, conversational speech; ambient noise and overlapping speech are among the situations where we still do not have satisfactory performance of current speech technology. For Norwegian, existing speech corpora are moderate in size compared to other languages, and mainly contain read and non-conversational speech. Matters are complicated further by large variations in dialects. The problem is that these “phenomena” occur in a variety of situations where automated solutions would be of great use.

The system we will develop in SCRIBE will fill the gap in current speech recognition systems for Norwegian. It will be robust to disfluencies that are typical of spontaneous conversational speech, and will support the spoken and written dialectal variation of the Norwegian Language. It will also be assessed on metrics that are more closely related to the semantic content of the transcription, rather than on the number of misrecognized words.",Universiteter,UoH-sektor,12000000,Giampiero Salvi,Institutt for elektroniske systemer,Trondheim

The workshop program will consist of presentations and poster sessions, where participants can present recent and ongoing work. Participants that would like to present their work will be asked to submit a two-page abstract or a full six-page paper. Additionally, there will be a panel discussion, where issues and recent developments in the field will be discussed. 
We have invited 5 high-profile keynote speakers. This will contribute to the quality and also increase the visibility of the workshop.

This can have a significant negative impact on relationship quality and social health as meaningful social interactions taper. The role of technology in promoting social health and participation for people with dementia is increasing, but the usage of such devices as a third party in social interactions to enhance communication quality is still in its infancy.

The system is intended to be used in tandem with their conversation partner to provide a shared activity that is both engaging and meaningful. I-CARE showed great promise in the piloting study, yet, no structured assessment of the effects on social health has been conducted. 
By demonstrating the potential of this technology to support PwD and their ICs, this can contribute to improved dyadic social health. This will be evaluated by two components: a sequential crossover field study in waiting group design and a qualitative component by the means of in-depth interviews. The field study allows for the effects of I-CARE to be evaluated using standardised, validated measurement tools. The interviews explore the possibilities of supporting dyadic interactions in a home-based environment. Together, this mix-methods study design will provide deeper insight into future implementation.",Ukjent,Annet,283900,Viktoria Hoel,Viktoria Hoel,NA

Det skal oppnås ved å etablere et nettverk for forskningsdrevet innovasjon, med vekt på digitalisering og endret publikumsadferd.  Nettverket vil bli etablert gjennom et mobiliseringsprosjekt, som arrangerer en serie samlinger med representanter fra kultursektoren og forskningen med fokus på sektorens innovasjonsutfordringer. Samlingene vil bruke korona og digitalisering av kultursektoren som rød tråd. Rekruttering til nettverket vil gjøres stegvis, ved at prosjektet kan by på relevante analyser og innhold fra tidligere gjennomførte prosjekter. Dette vil i sin tur motivere for de langsiktige innovasjonsprosjektene som nettverket skal initiere. Mobiliseringsprosjektet vil utgjøre oppstartsfasen for nettverket. Primærhensikten med nettverket er å etablere samarbeid på tvers av ovennevnte grenselinjer for på den måten å danne grobunn for forskningsdrevet innovasjon i en lite FoU-moden sektor.  Målet for mobiliseringsprosjektet er å identifisere prosjekteier og-deltakere for 1-2 konkrete FoU-søknader, med utspring i nettverket. Blant relevante tema for FoU-søknader kan være: hvordan norsk kultursektor etablere et digitalt kulturhus i samarbeidskonkurranse med de store internasjonale aktørene? Mulige forretningsmodeller for ulike deler av kultursektoren, hvis en større andel av konsumet gjøres digitalt? Hvordan kan kunstig intelligens og maskinlæring fremme sektorens innsikt i sitt publikum og hvordan kulturen interagerer med dem? Hvordan kan immaterielle rettigheter forvaltes slik at det utløser innovasjon på den ene siden, og samtidig sikrer rettighetshaverne på den andre? Hvordan kan digital formidling av kunst og kultur fremme publikums bruk? Hvordan kan krisedrevet innovasjon fremme kultur-Norge, og gjøre sektoren mer bærekraftig?

323296,Disruptive Service Robot for agile manufacturing,2020,2021,"We’re entering the early stages of the golden age of robotics. Robotics is already a huge multibillion-dollar market that is dominated by industrial robotics (IR) found, e.g., on automotive assembly lines around the world. These robots perform basic tasks repeatedly and are usually separated by caged walls from humans for safety. However, this is rapidly changing. Advances in perception, driven by deep learning, machine vision and intelligent software allow robots to safely navigate the real world, escape the manufacturing cages, and closely interact with humans. Today, IR and cobots are widely used to automate tasks. The service robot (SR) is being more common as new SRs are being brought to the market. SRs are designed to work in an unstructured environment, but they have a very limited ability to work in unstructured operations. Also, SR demands a programmer to implement static motion planning for each given task. To address this market need, the overall objective of our Eurostars project is to develop an innovative SR with a Cognitive Robotic Interface that will democratize robotics in the manufacturing and healthcare industry, being able to work in unstructured operations and bring robotic to a new level.
The main R&D challenges associated with this project are: 1) simplification of the SR programming; 2) efficient integration developing a solution with low production cost; 3) SR positioning and understanding of its surroundings.
This project will be carried out with our Danish partner RiACT as the project coordinator and lead applicant. Allinvent will act as leader and participant of several work packages, focusing on SR skills, hardware setup and tools development. 
The Eurostars program will provide the necessary financial input to develop our innovative solution, which has a huge potential to positively disrupt current SME manufactures production.

323362,Machine learning and uncertainty quantification for surrogate models of IoT environments,2021,2024,"I samråd med Kungliga tekniska högskolan er ""Machine learning and uncertainty quantification for surrogate models of IoT environments"" foreslått som tittel for PhD-oppgaven. Maskinlæring er metoder som lar datamaskiner finne frem til løsninger på egenhånd, med varierende grad av veiledning fra mennesker. En av fordelene med denne type tilnærminger er at maskiner kan finne løsninger som er umulige for mennesker å se. 

«Surrogate models» er en digital kopi/ tvilling av et system. En digital kopi kan brukes til simuleringer uten fare for å skade selve systemet, få en bedre forståelse av IoT-miljøet og gi bedre transparens og forklarbarhet  («explainability», dvs. god forståelse av hvordan og hvorfor AI/maskinlæring oppfører seg som det gjør for gitt scenario. Dette er sentral for å gi tillit til løsninger som tas frem.). 

«Uncertainty quantification» beskriver usikkerhet i resultatene og gir nødvendig informasjon til risikovurdering.
Risiko er usikkerhet rundt måloppnåelse. Risikovurdering gir et konkret grunnlag for å innføre målrettede tiltak for å håndtere identifisert risiko i IKT-systemer. Slik risikovurdering praktiseres i dag av blant annet NSM og Riksrevisjonen er metodene en blanding av analyse av dokumenter, intervjuer og innhenting av data fra IKT-systemet. I praksis blir mye av forståelsen av risiko og hva som er hensiktsmessige tiltak basert på subjektive vurderinger. I IoT-miljøer vil, som nevnt i FFI rapporten, slike vurderinger bli svært krevende og øke muligheten for feilaktige vurderinger.

Digitale kopier og ML /KI brukes i flere industrier for å understøtte risikovurderinger, men den spesifikke kombinasjonen for anvendelser i miljøer med mye IoT-utstyr er et foreløpig nytt forskningsfelt.",Øvrige offentlige,Øvrige,1811000,Lars Strand,NASJONAL SIKKERHETSMYNDIGHET (NSM),Bærum

Rike data i store volum i en helhetlig informasjonsmodell som utvikles kontinuerlig, skal åpne viktige mulighetsrom for forskning, teknologiutvikling og tjenesteinnovasjon. Dette skal igjen legge grunnlag for nye løsninger som reduserer bransjens store miljø- og klimaavtrykk og som bidrar til å skape grønne jobber og internasjonal konkurransekraft. 

Et hovedprosjekt med holistiske tilnærming til data vil kunne løfte en sektor som i volum utgjør Norges største fastlandsnæring. Bransjen er preget av kompleksitet, behov for bedre prosesser og et vesentlig digitalt etterslep. Data er en  nøkkel for høyere grad av innovasjon, og tilgang til data fra ett område vil legge grunnlag for helt nye og bærekraftige løsninger på et annet område. Nye volum og koblinger vil også legge grunnlag for anvendelse av kunstig intelligens i en helt annen skala enn i dag. 
 
Forprosjektet springer ut fra etablert samarbeid mellom forskning og næringsliv. Gjennom forprosjektet skal mål og ambisjoner konkretiseres, og potensial for verdiskaping dokumenteres.

Det vil defineres pilotprosjekter som kan akselerere bransjens bruk av data for å sikre en mer bærekraftig utvikling, forvaltning og transformasjon av bygg. Pilotprosjekter vil sikre at en kommer raskt i gang med implementering av standarder, samt at en fokuserer på behovet til bransjen og muligheten for å forenkle dialogen mellom forskjellige aktører (for eksempel mellom prosjekterings- og driftsfasen, eller mellom byggeier og offentlige instanser).",Teknisk-industrielle institutter,Instituttsektor,300000,Annette Fagerhaug Stephansen,NORCE Teknologi/Energi VESTLAND,Bergen
323690,E!114899: Automated high-throughput oncology drug screening in zebrafish using robotics and AI,2021,2024,"The project goal is to develop robots for oncology drug screening in zebrafish.

Cancer is the most burdensome disease in the world with an estimated 18.1 million new cases and 9.6 million
deaths in 2018. Drug candidates are assessed in living organisms late in the preclinical development process.
Consequently, only 9% of oncology drugs entering phase 1 clinical trials, complete phase 3 successfully.
Furthermore, 10,000 compounds are screened for each approved drug. High-throughput screening that provides
biologically relevant data is needed to 1) rapidly assess the large number of compounds generated in drug
discovery and 2) to increase the number of drugs that make it through clinical trials.

Zebrafish injected with patient-derived tumour cells (PDX) mimic in vivo responses and could be used in the early
drug screening workflow. Their small size, easy and inexpensive maintenance and abundant availability of genetic
tools make zebrafish highly suitable for oncology drug screening. Consortium partners and zebrafish CRO
market leaders ZeClinics (ZC) and BioReperia (BR) are experiencing strong market demand for zebrafish PDX
drug screening, but are critically impeded by their current low throughput, manual, labour intensive workflow. Through deep learning image recognition, advanced robotics and automated imaging, Life Science Methods (LSM)
and Confocal.nl will develop the ROBO-FISH robots that can inject 10 times faster than trained scientists and can
provide high-throughput image analysis for zebrafish. The Centre for Molecular Medicine Norway (NCMM)
and CROs ZC and BR will validate the robots in their expert zebrafish labs to generate feedback on performance,
applicability and reproducibility.

The ROBO-FISH consortium will deliver an injection robot and two types of imaging robots (high/low resolution) to
create a fast, accurate, easy to use, high-throughput workflow that could revolutionize oncology drug screening.",Universiteter,UoH-sektor,5694000,Camila Esguerra,UNIVERSITETET I OSLO SENTRALADMINISTRASJON,Oslo

Vi ønsker å tilpasse og kombinerer svært forskjellige norske battericelleteknologier med nye batteri -management systemer (BMS) slik at vi kan skreddersy batteri-løsninger som er optimalisert for bestemte sektorer. Disse løsningene vil vi da produsere i et svært fleksibel produksjonsanlegg også for mindre volumer enn bil og energisektoren krever, og å levere batteripakker og systemer til meget konkurransedyktige priser.

BATLINK kombinerer ulike teknologier med kunnskap fra norske celler og systemutviklere, forskningsinstitusjoner og en erfaren batterifabrikkbygger. Vi ønsker å tilby batterisystemer som enkelt kan tilpasses ulike bruksområder, kombinere celle-teknologier i hybridsystemer, og pilotere en monteringsprosess som er kommersielt levedyktig for mindre serier, slik NCE Maritime Cleantech og klyngen SAMS har identifisert.

Nøkkelen er bruk av en Industry 4.0-tilnærming, som omfatter digitale tvillinger, AGV-er og roboter, VR/ AR-system for kvalitetskontroll og læring. Denne integrerte og skalerbare løsning vil bruke maskinlæring, IoT og sanntidsdataanalyse for å produsere høykvalitets og tilpassede batteripakker. Prosjektets markedsmål er å gjøre den nyeste battericelleteknologien enklere og kommersielt lettere tilgjengelig for mange mindre industrier. Senere vil vi eksportere denne kunnskapen så vel som den norske batteriteknologien internasjonalt. Raufoss-miljøet er her ledende.

BATLINK vil dermed akselerere en raskere kommersialisering av den pågående battericelleutviklingen, og skalere en produksjon av løsninger som også vil gjøre norsk industri mer konkurransedyktig og grønnere.",Næringsliv,Næringsliv,300000,Jan-Olaf Willums,ZEM AS,Bærum

Each project has a unique focus: AutoMarus concerns maturing single-caged EL beyond J-IV, based on Devaela R&D (2016-17). AutoHatch concerns automation ZL hatcheries in the stages up until J-IV. A fibreglass shelf “superstructure” to be shared between cages and incubators has already been prototyped for operational flexibility. AutoHatch takes a multidisciplinary approach to solving the challenges inherent in the project. The challenges include ZL biology, ICT, automation engineering and internal hatchery logistics within and between incubators, incl. transfer to single-cages. We start out by confirming the survival and growth rates of ZL through the incubator water flow and the feed composition. Significantly improving the survival (5%->20%) and growth rate (J-IV maturation in 15 days from 21 days today) are among the goals for commercial success of AutoHatch. Survival and growth rates will be improved by:

A) Enabling timely and accurate feeding of the ZL incubator batch.
B) Implementing timely and accurate sorting of J-IVs. Both depend on developing the EL-specific automation and CVS.
C) Implementing an in-depth mapping of J-III and by novel feed composition to achieve continuously improved

323828,NordForsk - Intelligent farming and health control in landbased recirculating aquaculture systems,2021,2024,"Production of fish in land-based aquaculture contributes significantly to the production of animal protein in the human food-supply chain in the Nordic countries.  Recirculation aquaculture systems (RAS) provide an environmentally sustainable solution that is becoming more and more relevant for current production systems. However, considerable challenges with these production systems means narrow production margins and uncertainties regarding fish health and production performance. 

An extensive amount of information on water quality, feed use and health parameters are gathered through monitoring of the fish and their environment via sensors.  In most cases, these data are stored in separate datasystems, not utilizing the huge potential for more precise monitoring and reporting of the realtime health, welfare and growth of the fish.

We aim to integrate such data from many farms and production cycles and through the usage of Artificial Intelligence (AI), enabling the farmers to move from experience-based to knowledge-based decision making. This will enable a more sustainable production with regards to production margins, environmental impact and fish health and -welfare.

The best indicator of health and performance is the behaviour of the fish themselves. One major challenge in RAS is waste of feed. We will use AI and statistical models to develop a closed loop control of feeding to reduce feed waste and optimize growth, moving from a manual analysis and response to a knowledge-based automatic one. This will be done by the application of deep learning tools on video sequences of fish, teaching computer systems how the fish react when they are hungry and when they have been feed. 

In addition, statistical models will be used on the integrated datasources and video sequences to develop a system for early detection and warning of upcoming disease events, thus giving the farmer time to react in the narrow time-window between an adverse health event and death.",Primærnæringsinstitutter,Instituttsektor,2572000,Britt Bang Jensen,VETERINÆRINSTITUTTET,Ås

327297,NordForsk Machine learning applied to predicting and preventing production loss in aquaculture,2021,2023,"Every year, up to 20% of farmed salmonids die before slaughter. Episodes of mortality happen during stressful incidents and interventions such as parasite treatment, deteriorating water quality, and transport to slaughter. Large fish that die during stressful procedures before slaughter is of particular concern, considering the investment required for growing fish to this size. Such mortality is a serious welfare issue and poses a considerable obstacle to sustainability, ethics and economy of the Nordic aquaculture industry. Currently, the causes of stress-related mortality are uncertain, but an increasing body of evidence suggests that the majority die from heart failure due to abnormal heart shapes or other types of heart disease. We have access to preliminary data that link cardiac morphology to cardiac morbidity and stress-induced mortality.  Thus, abnormal heart shape may represent a novel and promising indicator of heart function, performance and risk of mortality. There are likely several causes underlying development of heart disease in farmed salmonids. Similar to humans, development of heart disease in fish may be linked to factors such as diet, physical activity, physical condition and stress from the environment. The DigiHeart project, a consortium of researchers and industry partners form Norway, Sweden and the Faroe Island will develop technology and control systems that use machine learning to continuously survey data about all these factors, in addition to operational and environmental conditions to identify causes behind heart disease and mortality in farmed salmonids.  In addition, the project will develop on-site tools to evaluate mortality risk prior to stressful operational practices on fish farms. Thus, by identifying factors leading to heart disease and mortality and developing tools that can predict performance and mortality, the consortium aims at improving sustainability and animal welfare and reducing mortality in salmonid aquaculture.",Universiteter,UoH-sektor,4995000,Ida Beitnes Johansen,NMBU Veterinærhøgskolen,Ås

Dette krever igjen at metoder for opplæring og support moderniseres.

Unifractal AS har utviklet et nytenkende plattform for opplæring, hvor utstyr gjenkjennes av algoritmer basert på kunstig intelligens, og brukere ved hjelp av dette gis tilgang til korte videoer med konkrete instruksjoner om hvordan utstyret brukes på akkurat denne lokasjonen. Plattformen er i dag i bruk på blant annet intensivavdeling ved UNN (Universitetssykehuset i Nord-Norge), og odontologi/tannlege- og musikkteknologistudiene ved UiT - Norges Arktiske Universitet. 

Nåværende samarbeidspartnere har påpekt et stort fremtidig behov for selvbetjeningsløsninger for pasienter og behov for støtte for ansatte når pasienter får komplekst teknisk utstyr med seg hjem for medisinsk behanling.

Det overordnede målet er å utvikle et beslutningsstøtteverktøy (CDSS) for bedre diagnose og behandling av pasienter med hjertesvikt. 
Hjertesvikt er en alvorlig diagnose med dårlig prognose. Opptil halvparten av alle pasienter med hjertesvikt dør innen 5 år etter diagnose. De aller fleste innen det første året. Det betyr at prognosen er dårligere enn for kreft generelt. Det er mange pasienter som ikke får riktig diagnose og som ikke behandles i henhold til retningslinjer. Dette medfører redusert livskvalitet og tapte leveår for pasienten, samt økte kostander for samfunnet som følge av en større belastning for helsevesenet da opptil 30% reinnlegges i løpet av det første året etter diagnosen. Behovet for bedre diagnostikk og behandling i henhold til guidelines er stort. 

Ved å utvikle et CDSS ser vi store gevinster for både pasienter, helsetjenesten, helsepersonell og samfunn:
- økt pasientsikkerhet for en sårbar pasientgruppe, 
- økt effektivitet, bedre kostnadseffektivitet og bedre presisjon i helsetjenesten enn vi har idag, 
- øket tid til pasientnær undersøkelse og kommunikasjon som sikrer diagnostisk presisjon og pasient compliance
- For samfunnet digitalisering og økt kunnskap om KI i helsesektoren og skalerbarhet ved privat-offentlig samarbeid

- Gjennomføre proof of technology (PoT) analyse med teknologi fra SAS Institute
- Gjennomføre en valideringsstudie basert på strukturerte data 
- Lage CDSS basert på PoT

328276,Midnattssolkonferansen for pasientnær kunstig intelligens 2021,2021,2021,"Midnattssolkonferansen er den 4. konferansen i en nasjonal stafett med mål om å øke kompetansen
innenfor kunstig intelligens i helsesektoren. Konferansene som har blitt arrangert tidligere er “Kunstig
intelligens i helsesektoren” (Bodø, 2019), “BigMed 2020” (Oslo, 2020), og “MMIV - Enabling imaging
technology transform patient care” (Bergen, 2020).

Målet med konferansene er å skape et forum der forskere og klinkere kan møtes for å dele erfaringer rundt
utvikling og anvendelse av kunstig intelligens i helsesektoren. Konferansene har også som mål å knytte
sammen eksisterende fagmiljøer både nasjonalt og internasjonalt. Kunstig intelligens i helsesektoren er et
nasjonalt satsningsområde der organisering av nasjonal samlingspunkter for deling av erfaringer er en
viktig komponent, noe som blant annet ble understreket i Helsedirektoratets nye rapport “Felles plan for
kunstig intelligens 2020”.",Universiteter,UoH-sektor,100000,Karl Øyvind Mikalsen,Institutt for fysikk og teknologi,Tromsø

329067,16TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON DESIGN SCIENCE RESEARCH IN INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY,2021,2021,"UiA will host the 16th edition of the DESRIST conference in August 2021.The conference attracts approximately 100 scholars, practitioners and policy-makers within design science research and information systems. Participants arrive from all over the world, with a majority from Europe and North-America. The 2021 conference theme will be: The Next Wave of Sociotechnical Design.

The recent global developments remind us of the potentials of digital technologies to redesign our lives
for the better. In 2020, the DSR community hosted their first ever virtual-only DESRIST and moved various
activities online that many would have expected to only work face-to-face. While this was a positive
experience, it also brings to our attention the potentially harmful unintended consequences of digital
technologies, if not used mindfully. Surveillance, digital divide, and algorithmic biases are among those
effects that have been debated in the media and elsewhere. Essentially though, these technologies are
first and foremost design artifacts, that is, humans design their instantiations and intentions. What can
we, the DSR community, do to help shape digital transformation and innovation to better serve people,
organizations, and society?

We will take a step back and revisit the roots of sociotechnical design to make them relevant in the
context of the current social and technological advances, including diminishing boundaries of
organizations, platformization, and the productive use of artificial intelligence. We need to embrace the
next wave of sociotechnical design. Our intention for DESRIST 2021 is that it will help the DSR community
find its role in this new era by clarifying and strengthening of DSR.",Universiteter,UoH-sektor,100000,Carl Erik Moe,Institutt for informasjonssystemer,Kristiansand
